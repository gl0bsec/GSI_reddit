Those services have contributed deeply to societal and economic transformations \\nin the Union and across the world. At the same time, the use of those services has also \\nbecome the source of new risks and challenges, both for society as a whole and individuals \\nusing such services. Digital services can support achieving Sustainable Development Goals \\nby contributing to economic, social and environmental sustainability. The coronavirus crisis \\nhas shown the importance of digital technologies in all aspects of modern life. It has clearly \\nshown the dependency of our economy and society on digital services and highlighted both \\nthe benefits and the risks stemming from the current framework for the functioning of digital \\nservices. \\nIn the Communication \\u2018Shaping Europe\\u2019s Digital Future\\u20192, the Commission committed to \\nupdate the horizontal rules that define the responsibilities and obligations of providers of \\ndigital services, and online platforms in particular.  \\nIn doing so, the Commission has taken account of the issues identified in the European \\nParliament\\u2019s own initiative reports and analysed the proposals therein. The European \\nParliament adopted two resolutions on the basis of Article 225 of the Treaty on the \\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the \\u2018Digital Services Act \\u2013 Improving the \\nfunctioning of the Single Market\\u20193 and on the \\u2018Digital Services Act: adapting commercial and \\ncivil law rules for commercial entities operating online\\u20194. The European Parliament also \\nadopted a resolution under the non-legislative procedure on the \\u2018Digital Services Act and \\nfundamental rights issues posed\\u20195. In substance, the resolutions are complementary in many \\naspects. They include a strong call for maintaining the core principles of the e-Commerce \\nDirective and for protecting fundamental rights in the online environment, as well as online \\nanonymity wherever technically possible. They call for transparency, information obligations \\nand accountability for digital services providers and advocate for effective obligations to \\ntackle illegal content online. They also advocate for public oversight at EU and national level, \\nand cooperation between competent authorities across jurisdictions in enforcing the law, \\nespecially when addressing cross-border matters.  \\nThe resolution on \\u2018Digital Services Act \\u2013 Improving the functioning of the Single Market\\u2019 \\ncalls for an ambitious reform of the existing EU e-commerce legal framework while \\nmaintaining the core principles of its liability regime, the prohibition of general monitoring \\n                                                 \\n1 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of \\ninformation society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on electronic \\ncommerce) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1). \\n2 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-europes-digital-future-feb2020_en_4.pdf  \\n3 European Parliament, Resolution on improving the functioning of the Single Market (2020/2018(INL)). \\n4 European Parliament, Resolution on adapting commercial and civil law rules for commercial entities operating \\nonline (2020/2019(INL)). \\n5 European Parliament, Resolution on the Digital Services Act and fundamental rights issues posed \\n(2020/2022(INI)) \\n EN \\n2 \\n EN \\nand the internal market clause, which it considers to be still valid today. Confirming the \\nobjectives of the e-Commerce Directive, the resolution calls for measures which have \\nconsumer protection at their core, by including a detailed section on online marketplaces, and \\nwhich ensure consumer trust in the digital economy, while respecting users\\u2019 fundamental \\nrights. The resolution also advocates for rules to underpin a competitive digital environment \\nin Europe, and envisages the Digital Services Act as a standard-setter at global level.   \\nThe resolution on \\u2018Digital Services Act: adapting commercial and civil law rules for \\ncommercial entities operating online\\u2019 calls for more fairness, transparency and accountability \\nfor digital services\\u2019 content moderation processes, ensuring that fundamental rights are \\nrespected, and guaranteeing independent recourse to judicial redress. The resolution also \\nincludes the request for a detailed \\u2018notice-and-action\\u2019 mechanism addressing illegal content, \\ncomprehensive rules about online advertising, including targeted advertising, and enabling the \\ndevelopment and use of smart contracts. \\nThe non-legislative resolution on the \\u2018Digital Services Act and fundamental rights issues \\nposed\\u2019 highlights the need for legal clarity for platforms and users, and respect for \\nfundamental rights given the rapid development of technology. It calls for harmonised rules \\nfor addressing illegal content online and for liability exemptions and content moderation. The \\nresolution also includes clear reporting and transparency responsibilities for platforms and \\nauthorities.The Council\\u2019s Conclusions6 also welcomed the Commission\\u2019s announcement of a \\nDigital Services Act, emphasising \\u2018the need for clear and harmonised evidence-based rules on \\nresponsibilities and accountability for digital services that would guarantee internet \\nintermediaries an appropriate level of legal certainty\\u2019, and stressing \\u2018the need to enhance \\nEuropean capabilities and the cooperation of national authorities, preserving and reinforcing \\nthe fundamental principles of the Single Market and the need to enhance citizens\\u2019 safety and \\nto protect their rights in the digital sphere across the Single Market\\u2019. This call for action was \\nreiterated in the Council\\u2019s Conclusions of 2 October 20207. \\nBuilding on the key principles set out in the e-Commerce Directive, which remain valid \\ntoday, this proposal seeks to ensure the best conditions for the provision of innovative digital \\nservices in the internal market, to contribute to online safety and the protection of \\nfundamental rights, and to set a robust and durable governance structure for the effective \\nsupervision of providers of intermediary services.  \\nThe proposal defines clear responsibilities and accountability for providers of intermediary \\nservices, and in particular online platforms, such as social media and marketplaces. By setting \\nout clear due-diligence obligations for certain intermediary services, including notice-and-\\naction procedures for illegal content and the possibility to challenge the platforms\\u2019 content \\nmoderation decisions, the proposal seeks to improve users\\u2019 safety online across the entire \\nUnion and improve the protection of their fundamental rights. Furthermore, an obligation for \\ncertain online platforms to receive, store and partially verify and publish information on \\ntraders using their services will ensure a safer and more transparent online environment for \\nconsumers. Recognising the particular impact of very large online platforms on our economy \\nand society, the proposal sets a higher standard of transparency and accountability on how the \\nproviders of such platforms moderate content, on advertising and on algorithmic processes. It \\nsets obligations to assess the risks their systems pose to develop appropriate risk management \\n                                                 \\n6 Council \\nConclusions \\non \\nShaping \\nEurope\\u2019s \\nDigital \\nFuture, \\n8711/20 \\nof \\n9 \\nJune \\n2020, \\nhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/44389/st08711-en20.pdf   \\n7 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf  \\n EN \\n3 \\n EN \\ntools to protect the integrity of their services against the use of manipulative techniques. The \\noperational threshold for service providers in scope of these obligations includes those online \\nplatforms with a significant reach in the Union, currently estimated to be amounting to more \\nthan 45 million recipients of the service. This threshold is proportionate to the risks brought \\nby the reach of the platforms in the Union; where the Union\\u2019s population changes by a certain \\npercentage, the Commission will adjust the number of recipients considered for the threshold, \\nso that it consistently corresponds to 10 % of the Union\\u2019s population. Additionally, the Digital \\nServices Act will set out a co-regulatory backstop, including building on existing voluntary \\ninitiatives. \\nThe proposal maintains the liability rules for providers of intermediary services set out in the \\ne-Commerce Directive \\u2013 by now established as a foundation of the digital economy and \\ninstrumental to the protection of fundamental rights online. Those rules have been interpreted \\nby the Court of Justice of the European Union, thus providing valuable clarifications and \\nguidance. Nevertheless, to ensure an effective harmonisation across the Union and avoid legal \\nfragmentation, it is necessary to include those rules in a Regulation. It is also appropriate to \\nclarify some aspects of those rules to eliminate existing disincentives towards voluntary own-\\ninvestigations undertaken by providers of intermediary services to ensure their users\\u2019 safety \\nand to clarify their role from the perspective of consumers in certain circumstances. Those \\nclarifications should help smaller, innovative providers scale up and grow by benefitting from \\ngreater legal certainty.  \\nA deeper, borderless single market for digital services requires enhanced cooperation among \\nMember States to guarantee effective oversight and enforcement of the new rules set out in \\nthe proposed Regulation. The proposal sets clear responsibilities for the Member State \\nsupervising the compliance of service providers established in its territory with the obligations \\nset by the proposed Regulation. This ensures the swiftest and most effective enforcement of \\nrules and protects all EU citizens. It aims at providing the simple and clear processes for both \\ncitizens and service providers to find relief in their interactions with supervising authorities. \\nWhere systemic risks emerge across the Union, the proposed Regulation provides for \\nsupervision and enforcement at Union level.  \\n\\u2022 \\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  \\nThe current EU legal framework regulating digital services is underpinned, first and foremost, \\nby the e-Commerce Directive. This proposed Regulation is without prejudice to the e-\\nCommerce Directive, and builds on the provisions laid down therein, notably on the internal \\nmarket principle set out in Article 3. The proposed Regulation provides for a cooperation and \\ncoordination mechanism for the supervision of the obligations it imposes. With regard to the \\nhorizontal framework of the liability exemption for providers of intermediary services, this \\nRegulation deletes Articles 12-15 in the e-Commerce Directive and reproduces them in the \\nRegulation, maintaining the liability exemptions of such providers, as interpreted by the Court \\nof Justice of the European Union. \\nDepending on the legal system of each Member State and the field of law at issue, national \\njudicial or administrative authorities may order providers of intermediary services to act \\nagainst certain specific items of illegal content. Such orders, in particular where they require \\nthe provider to prevent that illegal content reappears, must be issued in compliance with \\nUnion law, in particular with the prohibition of general monitoring obligations, as interpreted \\n EN \\n4 \\n EN \\nby the Court of Justice of the European Union8. This proposal, in particular its Article 8, \\nleaves this case-law unaffected. This proposal should constitute the appropriate basis for the \\ndevelopment of robust technologies to prevent the reappearance of illegal information, \\naccompanied with the highest safeguards to avoid that lawful content is taken down \\nerroneously; such tools could be developed on the basis of voluntary agreements between all \\nparties concerned and should be encouraged by Member States; it is in the interest of all \\nparties involved in the provision of intermediary services to adopt and implement such \\nprocedures; the provisions of this Regulation relating to liability should not preclude the \\ndevelopment and effective operation, by the different interested parties, of technical systems \\nof protection and identification and of automated recognition made possible by digital \\ntechnology within the limits laid down by Regulation 2016/679. \\n\\u2022 \\nConsistency with other Union policies \\nThe proposed Regulation introduces a horizontal framework for all categories of content, \\nproducts, services and activities on intermediary services. The illegal nature of such content, \\nproducts or services is not defined in this Regulation but results from Union law or from \\nnational law in accordance with Union law.  \\n \\nSector-specific instruments do not cover all the regulatory gaps evidenced in the impact \\nassessment report: they do not provide fully-fledged rules on the procedural obligations \\nrelated to illegal content and they only include basic rules on transparency and accountability \\nof service providers and limited oversight mechanisms. In addition, sector-specific laws cover \\nsituations where adapted approaches are necessary. In terms of scope, they are limited from \\ntwo perspectives. First, the sector-specific interventions address a small subset of issues (e.g. \\ncopyright infringements, terrorist content, child sexual abuse material or illegal hate speech, \\nsome illegal products). Second, they only cover the dissemination of such content on certain \\ntypes of services (e.g. sub-set of online platforms for copyright infringements, only video-\\nsharing platforms and only as regards audiovisual terrorist content or hate speech). However, \\nit is important that the relationship between the new proposed Regulation and the sector-\\nspecific instruments is clarified. \\n \\nThe proposed Regulation complements existing sector-specific legislation and does not affect \\nthe application of existing EU laws regulating certain aspects of the provision of information \\nsociety services, which apply as lex specialis. By way of example, the obligations set out in \\nDirective 2010/13/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/1808, on video-sharing platform \\nproviders (\\u201cAVSMD\\u201d) as regards audiovisual content and audiovisual commercial \\ncommunications will continue to apply. However, this Regulation applies to those providers \\nto the extent that the AVSMD or other Union legal acts, such as the proposal for a Regulation \\non addressing the dissemination on terrorist content online, do not contain more specific \\nprovisions applicable to them.  \\nThe framework established in the Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 on promoting fairness and \\ntransparency for business users of online intermediation services to ensure that business users \\nof such services and corporate website users in relation to online search engines are granted \\nappropriate transparency, fairness and effective redress possibilities, will apply as lex \\nspecialis.  \\n                                                 \\n8 \\nFor instance, Judgment of 3 October 2019, Glawischnig-Piesczek (C-18/18). \\n EN \\n5 \\n EN \\nFurthermore, the rules set out in the present proposal will be complementary to the consumer \\nprotection acquis and specifically with regard to Directive (EU) 2019/2161 amending Council \\nDirective 93/13/EEC and Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU which establish \\nspecific rules to increase transparency as to certain features offered by certain information \\nsociety services. \\nThis proposal is without prejudice to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data \\nProtection Regulation) and other Union rules on protection of personal data and privacy of \\ncommunications. For example, the measures concerning advertising on online platforms \\ncomplement but do not amend existing rules on consent and the right to object to processing \\nof personal data. They impose transparency obligations towards users of online platforms, and \\nthis information will also enable them to make use of their rights as data subjects. They also \\nenable scrutiny by authorities and vetted researchers on how advertisements are displayed and \\nhow they are targeted. \\nThis proposal will be complemented by further actions under the European Democracy \\nAction Plan COM(2020) 790 final, with the objective of empowering citizens and building \\nmore resilient democracies across the Union. In particular, the rules on codes of conduct \\nestablished in this Regulation could serve as a basis and be complemented by a revised and \\nstrengthened Code of practice on disinformation, building on the guidance of the \\nCommission.   \\nThe proposal is also fully consistent and further supports equality strategies adopted by the \\nCommission in the context of the Union of Equality. The proposal is without prejudice to the \\nCommission\\u2019s initiative aimed at improving the labour conditions of people working through \\ndigital platforms. \\nFinally, the proposed regulation builds on the Recommendation on illegal content of 2018.9 It \\ntakes account of experiences gained with self-regulatory efforts supported by the \\nCommission, such as the Product Safety Pledge10, the Memorandum of Understanding against \\ncounterfeit goods11, the Code of Conduct against illegal hate speech12, and the EU Internet \\nForum with regard to terrorist content. \\n2. \\nLEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  \\n\\u2022 \\nLegal basis  \\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the \\nEuropean Union, which provides for the establishment of measures to ensure the functioning \\nof the Internal Market.  \\nThe primary objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal \\nmarket, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more \\nspecifically, intermediary services). In line with this objective, the proposal aims to ensure \\nharmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the Union, by \\n                                                 \\n9 Commission Recommendation of 1.3.2018 on measures to effectively tackle illegal content online (C(2018) \\n1177 final) \\n10 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/product-safety-and-requirements/product-safety/product-\\nsafety-pledge_en  \\n11 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/intellectual-property/enforcement/memorandum-understanding-\\nsale-counterfeit-goods-internet_en  \\n12 https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-\\nxenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en  \\n EN \\n6 \\n EN \\naddressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting \\nfrom differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member \\nStates have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content \\nonline, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. At the same time, the \\nproposal provides for the appropriate supervision of digital services and cooperation between \\nauthorities at Union level, therefore supporting trust, innovation and growth in the internal \\nmarket. \\n\\u2022 \\nSubsidiarity  \\nTaking into account that the Internet is by its nature cross-border, the legislative efforts at \\nnational level referred to above hamper the provision and reception of services throughout the \\nUnion and are ineffective in ensuring the safety and uniform protection of the rights of Union \\ncitizens and businesses online. Harmonising the conditions for innovative cross-border digital \\nservices to develop in the Union, while maintaining a safe online environment, can only be \\nserved at Union level. \\nUnion level action provides predictability and legal certainty, and reduces compliance costs \\nacross the Union. At the same time, it fosters the equal protection of all Union citizens, by \\nensuring that action against illegal content online by providers of intermediary services is \\nconsistent, regardless of their place of establishment. A well coordinated supervisory system, \\nreinforced at Union level, also ensures a coherent approach applicable to providers of \\nintermediary services operating in all Member States. \\nTo effectively protect users online, and to avoid that Union-based digital service providers are \\nsubject to a competitive disadvantage, it is necessary to also cover to relevant service \\nproviders established outside of the Union whose operate on the internal market. \\n\\u2022 \\nProportionality \\nThe proposal seeks to foster responsible and diligent behaviour by providers of intermediary \\nservices to ensure a safe online environment, which allows Union citizens and other parties to \\nfreely exercise their fundamental rights, in particular the freedom of expression and \\ninformation. Key features of the proposal limit the Regulation to what is strictly necessary to \\nachieve those objectives. \\nIn particular, the proposal sets asymmetric due diligence obligations on different types of \\ndigital service providers depending on the nature of their services and their size, to ensure \\ntheir services are not misused for illegal activities and providers operate responsibly. This \\napproach addresses certain identified problems only there where they materialise, while not \\noverburdening providers unconcerned by those problems. Certain substantive obligations are \\nlimited only to very large online platforms, which due to their reach have acquired a central, \\nsystemic role in facilitating the public debate and economic transactions. Very small providers \\nare exempt from the obligations altogether. \\nAs regards digital service providers established outside of the Union offering services in the \\nUnion, the Regulation requires the appointment of a legal representative in the Union to \\nensure effective oversight and, where necessary, enforcement.  \\nProportionate to the obligations, and taking into account the cross-border nature of digital \\nservices, the proposal will introduce a cooperation mechanism across Member States with \\nenhanced Union level oversight of very large online platforms. Additionally, the proposal \\ndoes not amend sector-specific legislation or the enforcement and governance mechanisms set \\nthereunder, but provides for a horizontal framework to rely on, for aspects beyond specific \\ncontent or subcategories of services regulated in sector-specific acts. \\n EN \\n7 \\n EN \\nBy establishing a clear framework, accompanied by cooperation between and with Member \\nStates, as well as by self-regulation, this proposal aims to enhance legal certainty and increase \\ntrust levels, while staying relevant and effective in the long term because of the flexibility of \\nthe cooperation framework.  \\n\\u2022 \\nChoice of the instrument  \\nArticle 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union gives the legislator the \\npossibility to adopt regulations and directives.  \\nThe Commission has decided to put forward a proposal for a Regulation to ensure a consistent \\nlevel of protection throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free \\nprovision of the relevant services within the internal market, as well as guarantee the uniform \\nprotection of rights and uniform obligations for business and consumers across the internal \\nmarket. This is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators \\nand consumers alike. The proposed Regulation also ensures consistent monitoring of the \\nrights and obligations, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States, as well as effective \\ncooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States and at Union \\nlevel. \\n3. \\nRESULTS \\nOF \\nEX-POST \\nEVALUATIONS, \\nSTAKEHOLDER \\nCONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \\n\\u2022 \\nEx-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation \\nThis proposal builds on the evaluation of the e-Commerce Directive, conducted as a \\u2018back to \\nback\\u2019 evaluation with the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal. The specific \\nobjectives of the e-Commerce Directive were to ensure (i) a well-functioning internal market \\nfor digital services, (ii) the effective removal of illegal content online in full respect of \\n \\nfundamental rights, and (iii) an adequate level of information and transparency for consumers.\\nAs regards the effectiveness of the e-Commerce Directive, the evaluation shows that while \\nthe e-Commerce Directive has provided an important incentive for the growth of the internal \\nmarket for digital services, and enabled entry and scaling up of new providers of such \\nservices, the initial objectives have not been fully achieved.  \\nIn particular, the dynamic growth of the digital economy and the appearance of new types of \\nservice providers raises certain new challenges, dealt with differently by Member States, \\nwhere the initial set of objectives need to be clarified. In addition, these developments put an \\nadditional strain on achieving already existing objectives as the increased legal fragmentation \\nshows.  \\nThe evaluation also showed that while several new regulatory instruments make valuable \\ncontributions to the attainment of some of the policy objectives set out in the e-Commerce \\nDirective, they provide only sector-specific solutions for some of the underlying problems \\n(e.g. in addressing the proliferation of specific types of illegal activity). They therefore do not \\naddress such issues consistently for the entire digital ecosystem, as they are limited to certain \\ntypes of services or certain types of illegal content. Furthermore, while self-regulatory \\ninitiatives have generally shown positive results, they cannot be legally enforced, nor do they \\ncover all participants in the digital economy. As regards the efficiency of the e-Commerce \\nDirective, the Directive imposed only limited additional costs for Member States' \\nadministrations and providers of information society services. The evaluation has not revealed \\nparticularly high or disproportionate costs and no substantial concerns have been raised \\n EN \\n8 \\n EN \\nregarding impacts on small and medium-sized enterprises. The main concern in this regard is \\nrelated to the lack of clarity in the cooperation mechanism across Member States, creating \\nburdens and duplication of costs, despite the opposite objective of the Directive, in particular \\nwhere the supervision of online platforms is concerned. This has essentially reduced its \\nefficiency in maintaining the functioning of the internal market. \\nIn relation to questions about the continued relevance of the objectives pursued by the e-\\nCommerce Directive, the evaluation shows that the objectives of the e-Commerce Directive \\ncontinue to remain valid, while at the same time there are several new developments that are \\nnot well reflected in the existing public policy objectives. \\nFirst, the open public consultation, targeted submissions by stakeholders, reports issued by the \\nEuropean Parliament13 as well as Council conclusions14 confirm that the existing principles \\nand objectives of the e-Commerce Directive remain valid today. However, new information \\nasymmetries and risks have arisen since the entry into force of the Directive, notably related \\nto the emergence of online platforms, in particular very large ones, and the scale of the digital \\ntransformation. This is for example the case in the areas of algorithmic decision making (with \\nan impact on how information flows are intermediated online), or in online advertising \\nsystems.  \\nThe evaluation showed that the e-Commerce Directive is coherent with other EU \\ninterventions that took place since its adoption. The evaluation also did not identify any \\ninternal in-coherence of the e-Commerce Directive. \\nFinally, at least parts of the actual benefits of the e-Commerce Directive that the evaluation \\nidentified could be considered as EU added value. It is likely that Member States would have \\ncontinued applying their own regulatory systems without any common set of principles and \\nthat some Member States would have continued to have no horizontal rules in place at all. In \\nthe absence of robust evidence, it is however not possible to draw firm conclusions on the \\nextent of this EU added value.  \\n\\u2022 \\nStakeholder consultations  \\nOver the past five years, the Commission has consulted a wide range of different \\nstakeholders, including providers of digital services such as online platforms and other \\nintermediary services, businesses trading online, media publishers, brand owners and other \\nbusinesses, social partners, users of digital services, civil society organisations, national \\nauthorities, academia, the technical community, international organisations and the general \\npublic. An array of targeted consultation steps have captured thoroughly stakeholder views on \\nissues related to digital services and platforms over the last years. \\nThe open public consultation on the Digital Services Act was open for 14 weeks, between 2nd \\nof June and 8th of September and received 2,863 responses and around 300 position papers \\nfrom a diverse group of stakeholders. Most feedback was submitted by the general public \\n(66% from Union citizens, 8% from non-EU citizens), companies/ businesses organizations \\n(7.4%), business associations (6%), and NGOs (5.6%). This was followed by public \\nauthorities (2.2%), academic/research institutions (1.2%), trade unions (0.9%), and consumer \\nand environmental organisations (0.4%). \\n                                                 \\n13 European Parliament, ibidem \\n14 Shaping Europe\\u2019s digital future, available at: https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8711-2020-\\nINIT/en/pdf.  \\n EN \\n9 \\n EN \\nOverall, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders for a need for action, both in \\naddressing online safety and in furthering the internal market for digital services.  \\nStakeholders converge on the continued relevance of the main principles of the e-Commerce \\nDirective and agree that they should be maintained, including the internal market principle for \\nthe supervision of digital services, the liability regime, and the prohibition of general \\nmonitoring obligations.  \\nStakeholders also broadly agree on the need to upgrade the framework in light of today\\u2019s \\nchallenges by establishing clear obligations for service providers, harmonised across the EU. \\nA majority of respondents, all categories included, indicated that they have encountered both \\nharmful and illegal content, goods or services online, and specifically noted an alarming spike \\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. A large share of respondents who say they have notified \\nillegal content or goods to digital service providers expressed their dissatisfaction with the \\nresponse and the ineffectiveness of reporting mechanisms after the exposure took place. \\nMoreover, users perceive there to be a mismatch between providers\\u2019 policies as stated and \\ntheir concrete actions. \\nThere is broad consensus, including among service providers responding to the consultation, \\non the need for simple, standardised, transparent notice and action obligations, harmonised \\nacross the internal market. This is considered as essential to enable rapid responses to illegal \\ncontent and enhance legal clarity for users of platforms and for small platforms seeking to \\nscale in the internal market. Respondents also agree on the importance of a redress \\nmechanisms.  \\nConcerning online marketplaces, several stakeholders flagged the need for more targeted \\nmeasures such as the identification of sellers.  \\nRespondents also generally agree that the territorial scope for these obligations should include \\nall players offering goods, information or services in the Union, regardless of their place of \\nestablishment. A large share of respondents also emphasized the importance of these issues in \\nparticular where large platforms are concerned. \\nThere is a general agreement among stakeholders that \\u2018harmful\\u2019 (yet not, or at least not \\nnecessarily, illegal) content should not be defined in the Digital Services Act and should not \\nbe subject to removal obligations, as this is a delicate area with severe implications for the \\nprotection of freedom of expression.  \\nHowever, the way algorithmic systems shape information flows online is an area of concern \\namong a wide category of stakeholders. Several stakeholders, in particular civil society and \\nacademics, pointed out the need for algorithmic accountability and transparency audits, \\nespecially with regard to how information is prioritized and targeted. Similarly, regarding \\nonline advertising, stakeholder views echoed the broad concerns around the lack of user \\nempowerment and lack of meaningful oversight and enforcement.  \\nWhen it comes to enforcement, there is a general understanding among stakeholders that \\ncooperation between authorities should be improved both cross-border and within each \\nMember State. EU oversight is considered crucial and the majority of respondents seems to \\nfavour a unified oversight entity.  \\n\\u2022 \\nCollection and use of expertise  \\nThe preparatory steps for the proposal rest on an array of studies and expert advice, including \\na number of legal studies commissioned focusing on the implementation of the E-Commerce \\n EN \\n10 \\n EN \\nDirective and the state of legal fragmentation15, studies on algorithmic transparency and \\naccountability16, as well as internal studies on costs of content moderation, liability regimes \\nfor intermediaries, and cost of non-Europe, with the support of the Joint Research Centre of \\nthe European Commission. For gathering the views and perceptions of the general public, the \\nCommission ran a Eurobarometer survey in 2018 with a representative sample of over 33,000 \\nrespondents from all Member States17. \\nThe legal analysis also rests on a rich collection of case law, in particular by the Court of \\nJustice of the European Union, of several provisions of the e-Commerce Directive and related \\nacts, such as provisions concerning the interpretation of the notion of \\u201cinformation society \\nservices\\u201d18 or provisions concerning the liability of intermediary services providers19 The \\nCommission also gathered expertise and views through targeted consultations and \\nengagement activities, including a series of workshops, conferences, interviews with experts \\nand judges, consultations of the Expert Group on e-commerce, as well as numerous bilateral \\nmeetings and analysis of ad hoc position and research papers from organizations, industry \\nrepresentatives, civil society and academia.  \\nFinally, the analysis rests on additional literature review, studies and research papers \\nsubmitted by academics in the open public consultation and other independent studies, \\nincluding the collection of studies carried out for the European Parliament20.  \\n\\u2022 \\nImpact assessment \\nThe Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion with reservations on the impact \\nassessment, including suggestions for improvement21. The Impact Assessment report was \\nfurther revised along these lines, notably in clarifying the interlinks between the Digital \\nServices Act and the broader regulatory framework, providing more detailed descriptions of \\nthe policy options, and a more detailed analysis of the underlying evidence addressed in the \\nrevised impact assessment report.  \\nThe importance in our economy and society, but also the growing risks brought by digital \\nservices will continue to scale. In the baseline scenario, the Commission will continue to \\nenforce existing rules, including on sector-specific issues, and will support the self-regulatory \\n                                                 \\n15 Van Hoboken J. et al (2018), Hosting Intermediary Services and Illegal Content Online, and Schwemer, S., \\nMahler, T. & Styri, H.

However, faced with the evolving problems, Member States will continue to \\nlegislate independently. The legal fragmentation with the resulting patchwork of national \\nmeasures will not just fail to effectively tackle illegal activities and protect citizens\\u2019 \\nfundamental rights throughout the EU, it will also hinder new, innovative services from \\nscaling up in the internal market, cementing the position of the few players which can afford \\nthe additional compliance costs. This leaves the rule setting and enforcement mostly to very \\nlarge private companies, with ever-growing information asymmetry between online services, \\ntheir users and public authorities.  \\nThree main policy options were assessed, in addition to the baseline. Option 1 would codify \\nthe Recommendation of 2018: it would lay down a range of procedural obligations for online \\nplatforms to tackle illegal activities conducted by their users. The obligations would also \\ninclude the necessary safeguards in order to protect users\\u2019 fundamental rights and ensure \\ntransparency. It would also enhance the administrative cooperation mechanisms for \\nauthorities to resolve cross-border issues through a digital clearing house, facilitating \\ninformation flows. Option 2 would in addition to measures in option 1, remove disincentives \\nfor service providers to take voluntary measures against illegal content, and introduce \\nmeasures to enhance transparency around recommender systems and advertising. The \\nenforcement and cooperation mechanism would be enhanced with the appointment of a \\ncentral coordinator in each Member State. Option 3, building on the measures outlined in the \\nprevious options, includes targeted, asymmetric measures with stronger obligations for very \\nlarge online platforms which are prone to the highest levels of risks for the EU society and \\neconomy, as well as certain limited clarifications of the liability regime for providers of \\nintermediary services and an EU governance system with reinforced oversight and \\nenforcement powers. \\nThe assessment of the economic and social impacts identified, and the comparison of its \\neffectiveness, efficiency, coherence and proportionality showed that Option 3 would most \\neffectively meet the objectives of the intervention by establishing the proportionate \\nframework fit for adapting to emerging challenges in the dynamic digital world. The \\ncomponents included in Option 3 are also broadly supported by stakeholders, including \\npositions from the European Parliament and Member States.  \\nThe preferred option would support the access to the internal market for European Union \\nintermediary service providers and their ability to scale-up by reducing costs related to the \\nlegal fragmentation. While costs for compliance with due diligence obligations are expected, \\nit is estimated this is offset by reducing the current fragmentation through harmonisation. It is \\nexpected to have a positive impact on competitiveness, innovation and investment in digital \\nservices, in particular European Union start-ups and scale-ups offering platform business \\nmodels but also, to varying extents, on sectors underpinned and amplified by digital \\ncommerce.  \\nThe preferred option intends to define the appropriate division of responsibilities between \\nintermediary services, their recipients and authorities when fighting against illegal content \\nonline. To do so, it introduces an asymmetric approach to the due diligence obligations \\nimposed on very large online platforms: this is a supervised risk management approach, with \\nan important role of the governance system for enforcement. The asymmetric obligations are \\nonly imposed on very large online platforms, which have, based on the current data, not only \\nthe broadest reach, but are also the large companies with important turnover. Consequently, \\nwhile the targeted measures are more restrictive than for other companies, they are \\nproportionate to the ability of the companies to comply.  \\n EN \\n12 \\n EN \\nFor public authorities, the proposed option would cut the costs brought by the inefficiencies \\nand duplications in the existing set-up for the cooperation of authorities. While Member \\nStates would bear the costs of appointing a competent authority, new or already established, \\nthe efficiency gains are expected to outweigh them: for the individual authorities through \\nmutualisation of resources, better information flows, and straight-forward processes for \\ninteracting with their counterparts across the internal market, as well as with service \\nproviders. \\n\\u2022 \\nRegulatory fitness and simplification \\nThe Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal identifies the sole added value of Union \\nintervention addressing the risk of legal fragmentation triggered by divergent regulatory and \\nsupervisory approaches (hence without accounting for the increased safety and trust on digital \\nservices) in a possible increase of cross-border digital trade of 1 to 1.8%, i.e. the equivalent of \\nan increase in turnover generated cross-border of EUR 8.6 billion and up to EUR 15.5 billion.  \\nWith regard to added value in the enforcement of measures, the initiative creates important \\nefficiency gains in the cooperation across Member States and mutualising some resources for \\ntechnical assistance at EU level, for inspecting and auditing content moderation systems, \\nrecommender systems and online advertising on very large online platforms. This, in turn, \\nleads to an increased effectiveness of enforcement and supervision measures, whereas the \\ncurrent system relies to a large extent on the limited capability for supervision in a small \\nnumber of Member States.  \\n\\u2022 \\nFundamental rights  \\nUnion citizens and others are exposed to ever-increasing risks and harms online \\u2013 from the \\nspread of illegal content and activities, to limitations to express themselves and other societal \\nharms. The envisaged policy measures in this legislative proposal will substantially improve \\nthis situation by providing a modern, future-proof governance framework, effectively \\nsafeguarding the rights and legitimate interests of all parties involved, most of all Union \\ncitizens. The proposal introduces important safeguards to allow citizens to freely express \\nthemselves, while enhancing user agency in the online environment, as well as the exercise of \\nother fundamental rights such as the right to an effective remedy, non-discrimination, rights of \\nthe child as well as the protection of personal data and privacy online. \\nThe proposed Regulation will mitigate risks of erroneous or unjustified blocking speech, \\naddress the chilling effects on speech, stimulate the freedom to receive information and hold \\nopinions, as well as reinforce users\\u2019 redress possibilities. Specific groups or persons may be \\nvulnerable or disadvantaged in their use of online services because of their gender, race or \\nethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. They can be \\ndisproportionately affected by restrictions and removal measures following from (unconscious \\nor conscious) biases potentially embedded in the notification systems by users and third \\nparties, as well as replicated in automated content moderation tools used by platforms. The \\nproposal will mitigate discriminatory risks, particularly for those groups or persons and will \\ncontribute to the protection of the rights of the child and the right to human dignity online. \\nThe proposal will only require removal of illegal content and will impose mandatory \\nsafeguards when users\\u2019 information is removed, including the provision of explanatory \\ninformation to the user, complaint mechanisms supported by the service providers as well as \\nexternal out-of-court dispute resolution mechanism. Furthermore, it will ensure EU citizens \\nare also protected when using services provided by providers not established in the Union but \\nactive on the internal market, since those providers are covered too.  \\n EN \\n13 \\n EN \\nWith regard to service providers\\u2019 freedom to conduct a business, the costs incurred on \\nbusinesses are offset by reducing fragmentation across the internal market. The proposal \\nintroduces safeguards to alleviate the burden on service providers, including measures against \\nrepeated unjustified notices and prior vetting of trusted flaggers by public authorities. \\nFurthermore, certain obligations are targeted to very large online platforms, where the most \\nserious risks often occur and which have the capacity absorb the additional burden.  \\nThe proposed legislation will preserve the prohibition of general monitoring obligations of the \\ne-Commerce Directive, which in itself is crucial to the required fair balance of fundamental \\nrights in the online world. The new Regulation prohibits general monitoring obligations, as \\nthey could disproportionately limit users\\u2019 freedom of expression and freedom to receive \\ninformation, and could burden service providers excessively and thus unduly interfere with \\ntheir freedom to conduct a business. The prohibition also limits incentives for online \\nsurveillance and has positive implications for the protection of personal data and privacy. \\nAll measures in the proposal are fully compliant and aligned with the high standard of \\npersonal data protection and protection of privacy of communications and private life, set in \\nEU legislation. \\n4. \\nBUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  \\nThe budgetary impact of the proposal will be covered by the allocations foreseen in the MFF \\n2021-27 under the financial envelopes of the Digital Europe Programme and Single Market \\nProgramme as detailed in the legislative financial statement accompanying this proposal for a \\nregulation.These implications require also reprogramming of Heading 7 of the Financial \\nPerspective.  \\nThe legislative financial statement accompanying this proposal for a Regulation covers the \\nbudgetary impacts for the Regulation itself. \\n5. \\nOTHER ELEMENTS \\n\\u2022 \\nImplementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  \\nThe Commission will establish a comprehensive framework for continuously monitoring the \\noutput, results and impact of this legislative instrument upon the date of its application. Based \\non the established monitoring programme, an evaluation of the instrument is envisaged within \\nfive years from its entry into force.  \\n\\u2022 \\nDetailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  \\nChapter I sets out general provisions, including the subject matter and scope of the Regulation \\n(Article 1) and the definitions of key terms used in the Regulation (Article 2). \\nChapter II contains provisions on the exemption of liability of providers of intermediary \\nservices. More specifically, it includes the conditions under which providers of mere conduit \\n(Article 3), caching (Article 4) and hosting services (Article 5) are exempt from liability for \\nthe third-party information they transmit and store. It also provides that the liability \\nexemptions should not be disapplied when providers of intermediary services carry out \\nvoluntary own-initiative investigations or comply with the law (Article 6) and it lays down a \\nprohibition of general monitoring or active fact-finding obligations for those providers \\n(Article 7). Finally, it imposes an obligation on providers of intermediary services in respect \\nof orders from national judicial or administrative authorities to act against illegal content \\n(Article 8) and to provide information (Article 9).  \\n EN \\n14 \\n EN \\nChapter III sets out the due diligence obligations for a transparent and safe online \\nenvironment, in five different sections. \\nSection 1 lays down obligations applicable to all providers of intermediary services, in \\nparticular: the obligation to establish a single point of contact to facilitate direct \\ncommunication with Member States\\u2019 authorities, the Commission and the Board (Article 10); \\nthe obligation to designate a legal representative in the Union for providers not established in \\nany Member State, but offering their services in the Union (Article 11); the obligation to set \\nout in their terms and conditions any restrictions that they may impose on the use of their \\nservices and to act responsibly in applying and enforcing those restrictions (Article 12); and \\ntransparency reporting obligations in relation to the removal and the disabling of information \\nconsidered to be illegal content or contrary to the providers\\u2019 terms and conditions (Article 13). \\nSection 2 lays down obligations, additional to those under Section 1, applicable to providers \\nof hosting services. In particular, that section obliges those providers to put in place \\nmechanisms to allow third parties to notify the presence of alleged illegal content (Article 14). \\nFurthermore, if such a provider decides to remove or disable access to specific information \\nprovided by a recipient of the service, it imposes the obligation to provide that recipient with a \\nstatement of reasons (Article 15).  \\nSection 3 lays down obligations applicable to all online platforms, additional to those under \\nSections 1 and 2. The Section specifies that it does not apply to online platforms that are \\nmicro or small enterprises within the meaning of the Annex to Recommendation 2003/361/EC \\n(Article 16). The Section lays down the obligation for online platforms to provide an internal \\ncomplaint-handling system in respect of decisions taken in relation to alleged illegal content \\nor information incompatible with their terms and conditions (Article 17). It also obliges online \\nplatforms to engage with certified out-of-court dispute settlement bodies to resolve any \\ndispute with users of their services (Article 18). It further obliges online platforms to ensure \\nthat notices submitted by entities granted the status of trusted flaggers are treated with priority \\n(Article 19) and sets out the measures online platforms are to adopt against misuse (Article \\n20). Furthermore, this Section includes a requirement for online platforms to inform \\ncompetent enforcement authorities in the event they become aware of any information giving \\nrise to a suspicion of serious criminal offences involving a threat to the life or safety of \\npersons (Article 21). The Section also obliges online platforms to receive, store, make \\nreasonable efforts to assess the reliability of and publish specific information on the traders \\nusing their services where those online platforms allow consumers to conclude distance \\ncontracts with those traders (Article 22). Those online platforms are also obliged to organise \\ntheir interface in a way that enables traders to respect Union consumer and product safety law \\n(Article 22a). Online platforms are also obliged to publish reports on their activities relating to \\nthe removal and the disabling of information considered to be illegal content or contrary to \\ntheir terms and conditions (Article 23). The Section also includes transparency obligations for \\nonline platforms in respect of online advertising (Article 24).  \\nSection 4 lays down obligations, additional to the obligations laid down in Sections 1 to 3, for \\nvery large online platforms (as defined by Article 25) to manage systemic risks. Very large \\nonline platforms are obliged to conduct risk assessments on the systemic risks brought about \\nby or relating to the functioning and use of their services (Article 26) and to take reasonable \\nand effective measures aimed at mitigating those risks (Article 27). They are also to submit \\nthemselves to external and independent audits (Article 28). The Section includes also a \\nspecific obligation in case very large online platforms use recommender systems (Article 29) \\nor display online advertising on their online interface (Article 30). Furthermore, the Section \\n EN \\n15 \\n EN \\nsets out the conditions under which very large online platforms provide access to data to the \\nDigital Services Coordinator of establishment or the Commission and vetted researchers \\n(Article 31), the obligation to appoint one or more compliance officers to ensure compliance \\nwith the obligations laid down in the Regulation (Article 32) and specific, additional \\ntransparency reporting obligations (Article 33).  \\nSection 5 contains transversal provisions concerning due diligence obligations, namely the \\nprocesses for which the Commission will support and promote the development and \\nimplementation of harmonised European standards (Article 34); the framework for the \\ndevelopment of codes of conduct (Article 35); and the framework for the development of \\nspecific codes of conduct for online advertising (Article 36). There is also a provision on \\ncrisis protocols to address extraordinary circumstances affecting public security or public \\nhealth (Article 37). \\nChapter IV contains the provisions concerning the implementation and enforcement of this \\nRegulation.  \\nSection 1 lays down provisions concerning national competent authorities, including Digital \\nServices Coordinators, which are the primary national authorities designated by the Member \\nStates for the consistent application of this Regulation (Article 38). The Digital Services \\nCoordinators, like other designated competent authorities, are independent and perform their \\ntasks impartially, transparently and in a timely manner (Article 39). Member States where the \\nmain establishment of the provider is located have jurisdiction to enforce this Regulation \\n(Article 40). The Digital Services Coordinators are granted specific powers (Article 41). \\nMember States are to lay down rules on penalties applicable to breaches of the obligations by \\nproviders of intermediary services under this Regulation (Article 42). Digital Services \\nCoordinators can receive complaints against providers of intermediary services for breaches \\nof the obligations laid down in this Regulation (Article 43). Digital Services Coordinators are \\nrequired to publish annual reports on their activities (Article 44) and to cooperate with Digital \\nServices Coordinators of other Member States (Article 45). Digital Services Coordinators can \\nalso participate in joint investigations with regard to matters covered by the Regulation \\n(Article 46).  \\nSection 2 lays down provisions regarding the European Board for Digital Services, an \\nindependent advisory group of Digital Services Coordinators (Article 47). It also sets out the \\nstructure of that Board (Article 48) and its tasks (Article 49).  \\nSection 3 concerns the supervision, investigation, enforcement and monitoring of very large \\nonline platforms. It provides for enhanced supervision in the event such platforms infringe the \\nprovisions of Chapter III, Section 4 (Article 50). It also provides the possibility for the \\nCommission to intervene vis \\u00e0 vis very large online platforms in case the infringements \\npersist (Article 51). In these cases the Commission can carry out investigations, including \\nthrough requests for information (Article 52), interviews (Article 53) and on-site inspections \\n(Article 54), can adopt interim measures (Article 55) and make binding commitments by very \\nlarge online platforms (Article 56), as well as monitor their compliance with the Regulation \\n(Article 57). In case of non-compliance, the Commission can adopt non-compliance decisions \\n(Article 58), as well as fines (Article 59) and periodic penalty payments (Article 60) for \\nbreaches of the Regulation by very large online platforms as well as for supply of incorrect, \\nincomplete or misleading information in the context of the investigation. The Regulation sets \\nalso a limitation period for the imposition of penalties (Article 61) and for their enforcement \\n(Article 62). Finally, the Regulation sets the procedural guarantees in front of the \\n EN \\n16 \\n EN \\nCommission, in particular the right to be heard and of access to the file (Article 63) and the \\npublication of decisions (Article 64). The Section also provides for the cooperation of the \\nCommission with national courts (Article 65) and for the adoption of implementing acts on \\npractical arrangement on the proceedings (Article 66).  \\nSection 4 includes the common provisions on enforcement. It first lays down rules on an \\ninformation-sharing \\nsystem \\nsupporting \\ncommunications \\nbetween \\nDigital \\nServices \\nCoordinators, the Commission and the Board (Article 67). It also includes the right of \\nrecipients of intermediary services to mandate a body, organisation and association to exercise \\ntheir rights on their behalf (article 68). \\nSection 5 relates to the adoption of delegated and implementing acts in accordance with \\nArticles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, respectively \\n(Articles 69 and 70). \\nFinally, Chapter V contains the final provisions of this Regulation, which concern the \\ndeletion of Articles 12 to 15 of the e-Commerce Directive given that they have been \\nincorporated in the Regulation (Article 71), amendments to Directive 2020/XX/EC (Article \\n72), evaluation of the Regulation (Article 73), and its entry into force and application (Article \\n74). \\n EN \\n17 \\n EN \\n2020/0361 (COD) \\nProposal for a \\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL \\non a Single Market For Digital Services (Digital Services Act) and amending Directive \\n2000/31/EC \\n(Text with EEA relevance) \\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, \\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular \\nArticle 114 thereof, \\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission, \\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, \\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee22, \\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions23, \\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor24, \\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, \\nWhereas:  \\n(1) \\nInformation society services and especially intermediary services have become an \\nimportant part of the Union\\u2019s economy and daily life of Union citizens. Twenty years \\nafter the adoption of the existing legal framework applicable to such services laid \\ndown in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council25, new \\nand innovative business models and services, such as online social networks and \\nmarketplaces, have allowed business users and consumers to impart and access \\ninformation and engage in transactions in novel ways. A majority of Union citizens \\nnow uses those services on a daily basis. However, the digital transformation and \\nincreased use of those services has also resulted in new risks and challenges, both for \\nindividual users and for society as a whole.  \\n(2) \\nMember States are increasingly introducing, or are considering introducing, national \\nlaws on the matters covered by this Regulation, imposing, in particular, diligence \\nrequirements for providers of intermediary services. Those diverging national laws \\nnegatively affect the internal market, which, pursuant to Article 26 of the Treaty, \\ncomprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods and \\nservices and freedom of establishment are ensured, taking into account the inherently \\n                                                 \\n22 OJ C , , p. . \\n23 OJ C , , p. . \\n24 OJ C, p. \\n25 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of \\ninformation society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market ('Directive on electronic \\ncommerce') (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1).  \\n EN \\n18 \\n EN \\ncross-border nature of the internet, which is generally used to provide those services. \\nThe conditions for the provision of intermediary services across the internal market \\nshould be harmonised, so as to provide businesses with access to new markets and \\nopportunities to exploit the benefits of the internal market, while allowing consumers \\nand other recipients of the services to have increased choice.  \\n(3) \\nResponsible and diligent behaviour by providers of intermediary services is essential \\nfor a safe, predictable and trusted online environment and for allowing Union citizens \\nand other persons to exercise their fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter of \\nFundamental Rights of the European Union (\\u2018Charter\\u2019), in particular the freedom of \\nexpression and information and the freedom to conduct a business, and the right to \\nnon-discrimination.  \\n(4) \\nTherefore, in order to safeguard and improve the functioning of the internal market, a \\ntargeted set of uniform, effective and proportionate mandatory rules should be \\nestablished at Union level. This Regulation provides the conditions for innovative \\ndigital services to emerge and to scale up in the internal market. The approximation of \\nnational regulatory measures at Union level concerning the requirements for providers \\nof intermediary services is necessary in order to avoid and put an end to fragmentation \\nof the internal market and to ensure legal certainty, thus reducing uncertainty for \\ndevelopers and fostering interoperability. By using requirements that are technology \\nneutral, innovation should not be hampered but instead be stimulated.  \\n(5) \\nThis Regulation should apply to providers of certain information society services as \\ndefined in Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council26, \\nthat is, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic \\nmeans and at the individual request of a recipient. Specifically, this Regulation should \\napply to providers of intermediary services, and in particular intermediary services \\nconsisting of services known as \\u2018mere conduit\\u2019, \\u2018caching\\u2019 and \\u2018hosting\\u2019 services, \\ngiven that the exponential growth of the use made of those services, mainly for \\nlegitimate and socially beneficial purposes of all kinds, has also increased their role in \\nthe intermediation and spread of unlawful or otherwise harmful information and \\nactivities.  \\n(6) \\nIn practice, certain providers of intermediary services intermediate in relation to \\nservices that may or may not be provided by electronic means, such as remote \\ninformation technology services, transport, accommodation or delivery services. This \\nRegulation should apply only to intermediary services and not affect requirements set \\nout in Union or national law relating to products or services intermediated through \\nintermediary services, including in situations where the intermediary service \\nconstitutes an integral part of another service which is not an intermediary service as \\nspecified in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  \\n(7) \\nIn order to ensure the effectiveness of the rules laid down in this Regulation and a \\nlevel playing field within the internal market, those rules should apply to providers of \\nintermediary services irrespective of their place of establishment or residence, in so far \\nas they provide services in the Union, as evidenced by a substantial connection to the \\nUnion. \\n                                                 \\n26 Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a \\nprocedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information \\nSociety services (OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1). \\n EN \\n19 \\n EN \\n(8) \\nSuch a substantial connection to the Union should be considered to exist where the \\nservice provider has an establishment in the Union or, in its absence, on the basis of \\nthe existence of a significant number of users in one or more Member States, or the \\ntargeting of activities towards one or more Member States. The targeting of activities \\ntowards one or more Member States can be determined on the basis of all relevant \\ncircumstances, including factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally \\nused in that Member State, or the possibility of ordering products or services, or using \\na national top level domain. The targeting of activities towards a Member State could \\nalso be derived from the availability of an application in the relevant national \\napplication store, from the provision of local advertising or advertising in the language \\nused in that Member State, or from the handling of customer relations such as by \\nproviding customer service in the language generally used in that Member State. A \\nsubstantial connection should also be assumed where a service provider directs its \\nactivities to one or more Member State as set out in Article 17(1)(c) of Regulation \\n(EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council27. On the other hand, \\nmere technical accessibility of a website from the Union cannot, on that ground alone, \\nbe considered as establishing a substantial connection to the Union.  \\n(9) \\nThis Regulation should complement, yet not affect the application of rules resulting \\nfrom other acts of Union law regulating certain aspects of the provision of \\nintermediary services, in particular Directive 2000/31/EC, with the exception of those \\nchanges introduced by this Regulation, Directive 2010/13/EU of the European \\nParliament and of the Council as amended,28 and Regulation (EU) \\u2026/.. of the \\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council29 \\u2013 proposed Terrorist Content Online \\nRegulation. Therefore, this Regulation leaves those other acts, which are to be \\nconsidered lex specialis in relation to the generally applicable framework set out in \\nthis Regulation, unaffected. However, the rules of this Regulation apply in respect of \\nissues that are not or not fully addressed by those other acts as well as issues on which \\nthose other acts leave Member States the possibility of adopting certain measures at \\nnational level.  \\n(10) \\nFor reasons of clarity, it should also be specified that this Regulation is without \\nprejudice to Regulation (EU) 2019/1148 of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil30 and Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil,31, Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council32 and \\n                                                 \\n27 Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on \\njurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (OJ L351, \\n20.12.2012, p.1). \\n28 Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of \\ncertain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the \\nprovision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) (Text with EEA relevance), \\nOJ L 95, 15.4.2010, p. 1 . \\n29 Regulation (EU) \\u2026/.. of the European Parliament and of the Council  \\u2013 proposed Terrorist Content Online \\nRegulation \\n30 Regulation (EU) 2019/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the marketing and use of \\nexplosives precursors, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 98/2013 \\n(OJ L 186, 11.7.2019, p. 1). \\n31 Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on promoting \\nfairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services (OJ L 186, 11.7.2019, p. 57). \\n32 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the \\nprocessing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on \\nprivacy and electronic communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37. \\n EN \\n20 \\n EN \\nRegulation [\\u2026/\\u2026] on temporary derogation from certain provisions of Directive \\n2002/58/EC33 as well as Union law on consumer protection, in particular Directive \\n2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council34, Directive 2011/83/EU of \\nthe European Parliament and of the Council35 and Directive 93/13/EEC of the \\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council36, as amended by Directive (EU) 2019/2161 \\nof the European Parliament and of the Council37, and on the protection of personal \\ndata, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil.38 The protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data \\nis solely governed by the rules of Union law on that subject, in particular Regulation \\n(EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC. This Regulation is also without prejudice to \\nthe rules of Union law on working conditions. \\n(11) \\nIt should be clarified that this Regulation is without prejudice to the rules of Union law \\non copyright and related rights, which establish specific rules and procedures that \\nshould remain unaffected. \\n(12) \\nIn order to achieve the objective of ensuring a safe, predictable and trusted online \\nenvironment, for the purpose of this Regulation the concept of \\u201cillegal content\\u201d should \\nbe defined broadly and also covers information relating to illegal content, products, \\nservices and activities. In particular, that concept should be understood to refer to \\ninformation, irrespective of its form, that under the applicable law is either itself \\nillegal, such as illegal hate speech or terrorist content and unlawful discriminatory \\ncontent, or that relates to activities that are illegal, such as the sharing of images \\ndepicting child sexual abuse, unlawful non-consensual sharing of private images, \\nonline stalking, the sale of non-compliant or counterfeit products, the non-authorised \\nuse of copyright protected material or activities involving infringements of consumer \\nprotection law. In this regard, it is immaterial whether the illegality of the information \\nor activity results from Union law or from national law that is consistent with Union \\nlaw and what the precise nature or subject matter is of the law in question.  \\n(13) \\nConsidering the particular characteristics of the services concerned and the \\ncorresponding need to make the providers thereof subject to certain specific \\nobligations, it is necessary to distinguish, within the broader category of providers of \\nhosting services as defined in this Regulation, the subcategory of online platforms. \\nOnline platforms, such as social networks or online marketplaces, should be defined as \\n                                                 \\n33 Regulation [\\u2026/\\u2026] on temporary derogation from certain provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC.  \\n34 Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair \\nbusiness-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive \\n84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \\nand Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (\\u2018Unfair Commercial \\nPractices Directive\\u2019)  \\n35 Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, \\namending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil and repealing Council Directive 85/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of \\nthe Council. \\n36 \\nCouncil Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts. \\n37 Directive (EU) 2019/2161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 amending \\nCouncil Directive 93/13/EEC and Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU of the European \\nParliament and of the Council as regards the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer \\nprotection rules \\n38 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of \\nnatural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and \\nrepealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1). \\n EN \\n21 \\n EN \\nproviders of hosting services that not only store information provided by the recipients \\nof the service at their request, but that also disseminate that information to the public, \\nagain at their request. However, in order to avoid imposing overly broad obligations, \\nproviders of hosting services should not be considered as online platforms where the \\ndissemination to the public is merely a minor and purely ancillary feature of another \\nservice and that feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without that \\nother, principal service, and the integration of that feature is not a means to circumvent \\nthe applicability of the rules of this Regulation applicable to online platforms. For \\nexample, the comments section in an online newspaper could constitute such a feature, \\nwhere it is clear that it is ancillary to the main service represented by the publication of \\nnews under the editorial responsibility of the publisher. \\n(14) \\nThe concept of \\u2018dissemination to the public\\u2019, as used in this Regulation, should entail \\nthe making available of information to a potentially unlimited number of persons, that \\nis, making the information easily accessible to users in general without further action \\nby the recipient of the service providing the information being required, irrespective of \\nwhether those persons actually access the information in question. The mere \\npossibility to create groups of users of a given service should not, in itself, be \\nunderstood to mean that the information disseminated in that manner is not \\ndisseminated to the public. However, the concept should exclude dissemination of \\ninformation within closed groups consisting of a finite number of pre-determined \\npersons. Interpersonal communication services, as defined in Directive (EU) \\n2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council,39 such as emails or private \\nmessaging services, fall outside the scope of this Regulation. Information should be \\nconsidered disseminated to the public within the meaning of this Regulation only \\nwhere that occurs upon the direct request by the recipient of the service that provided \\nthe information.  \\n(15) \\nWhere some of the services provided by a provider are covered by this Regulation \\nwhilst others are not, or where the services provided by a provider are covered by \\ndifferent sections of this Regulation, the relevant provisions of this Regulation should \\napply only in respect of those services that fall within their scope. \\n(16) \\nThe legal certainty provided by the horizontal framework of conditional exemptions \\nfrom liability for providers of intermediary services, laid down in Directive \\n2000/31/EC, has allowed many novel services to emerge and scale-up across the \\ninternal market. That framework should therefore be preserved. However, in view of \\nthe divergences when transposing and applying the relevant rules at national level, and \\nfor reasons of clarity and coherence, that framework should be incorporated in this \\nRegulation. It is also necessary to clarify certain elements of that framework, having \\nregard to case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  \\n(17) \\nThe relevant rules of Chapter II should only establish when the provider of \\nintermediary services concerned cannot be held liable in relation to illegal content \\nprovided by the recipients of the service. Those rules should not be understood to \\nprovide a positive basis for establishing when a provider can be held liable, which is \\nfor the applicable rules of Union or national law to determine. Furthermore, the \\nexemptions from liability established in this Regulation should apply in respect of any \\n                                                 \\n39 Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing \\nthe European Electronic Communications Code (Recast), OJ L 321, 17.12.2018, p. 36 \\n EN \\n22 \\n EN \\ntype of liability as regards any type of illegal content, irrespective of the precise \\nsubject matter or nature of those laws. \\n(18) \\nThe exemptions from liability established in this Regulation should not apply where, \\ninstead of confining itself to providing the services neutrally, by a merely technical \\nand automatic processing of the information provided by the recipient of the service, \\nthe provider of intermediary services plays an active role of such a kind as to give it \\nknowledge of, or control over, that information. Those exemptions should accordingly \\nnot be available in respect of liability relating to information provided not by the \\nrecipient of the service but by the provider of intermediary service itself, including \\nwhere the information has been developed under the editorial responsibility of that \\nprovider. \\n(19) \\nIn view of the different nature of the activities of \\u2018mere conduit\\u2019, \\u2018caching\\u2019 and \\n\\u2018hosting\\u2019 and the different position and abilities of the providers of the services in \\nquestion, it is necessary to distinguish the rules applicable to those activities, in so far \\nas under this Regulation they are subject to different requirements and conditions and \\ntheir scope differs, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union. \\n(20) \\nA provider of intermediary services that deliberately collaborates with a recipient of \\nthe services in order to undertake illegal activities does not provide its service \\nneutrally and should therefore not be able to benefit from the exemptions from liability \\nprovided for in this Regulation.  \\n(21) \\nA provider should be able to benefit from the exemptions from liability for \\u2018mere \\nconduit\\u2019 and for \\u2018caching\\u2019 services when it is in no way involved with the information \\ntransmitted. This requires, among other things, that the provider does not modify the \\ninformation that it transmits. However, this requirement should not be understood to \\ncover manipulations of a technical nature which take place in the course of the \\ntransmission, as such manipulations do not alter the integrity of the information \\ntransmitted.  \\n(22) \\nIn order to benefit from the exemption from liability for hosting services, the provider \\nshould, upon obtaining actual knowledge or awareness of illegal content, act \\nexpeditiously to remove or to disable access to that content. The removal or disabling \\nof access should be undertaken in the observance of the principle of freedom of \\nexpression. The provider can obtain such actual knowledge or awareness through, in \\nparticular, its own-initiative investigations or notices submitted to it by individuals or \\nentities in accordance with this Regulation in so far as those notices are sufficiently \\nprecise and adequately substantiated to allow a diligent economic operator to \\nreasonably identify, assess and where appropriate act against the allegedly illegal \\ncontent. \\n(23) \\nIn order to ensure the effective protection of consumers when engaging in \\nintermediated commercial transactions online, certain providers of hosting services, \\nnamely, online platforms that allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with \\ntraders, should not be able to benefit from the exemption from liability for hosting \\nservice providers established in this Regulation, in so far as those online platforms \\npresent the relevant information relating to the transactions at issue in such a way that \\nit leads consumers to believe that the information was provided by those online \\nplatforms themselves or by recipients of the service acting under their authority or \\ncontrol, and that those online platforms thus have knowledge of or control over the \\ninformation, even if that may in reality not be the case. In that regard, is should be \\ndetermined objectively, on the basis of all relevant circumstances, whether the \\n EN \\n23 \\n EN \\npresentation could lead to such a belief on the side of an average and reasonably well-\\ninformed consumer.  \\n(24) \\nThe exemptions from liability established in this Regulation should not affect the \\npossibility of injunctions of different kinds against providers of intermediary services, \\neven where they meet the conditions set out as part of those exemptions. Such \\ninjunctions could, in particular, consist of orders by courts or administrative \\nauthorities requiring the termination or prevention of any infringement, including the \\nremoval of illegal content specified in such orders, issued in compliance with Union \\nlaw, or the disabling of access to it. \\n(25) \\nIn order to create legal certainty and not to discourage activities aimed at detecting, \\nidentifying and acting against illegal content that providers of intermediary services \\nmay undertake on a voluntary basis, it should be clarified that the mere fact that \\nproviders undertake such activities does not lead to the unavailability of the \\nexemptions from liability set out in this Regulation, provided those activities are \\ncarried out in good faith and in a diligent manner. In addition, it is appropriate to \\nclarify that the mere fact that those providers take measures, in good faith, to comply \\nwith the requirements of Union law, including those set out in this Regulation as \\nregards the implementation of their terms and conditions, should not lead to the \\nunavailability of those exemptions from liability. Therefore, any such activities and \\nmeasures that a given provider may have taken should not be taken into account when \\ndetermining whether the provider can rely on an exemption from liability, in particular \\nas regards whether the provider provides its service neutrally and can therefore fall \\nwithin the scope of the relevant provision, without this rule however implying that the \\nprovider can necessarily rely thereon.  \\n(26) \\nWhilst the rules in Chapter II of this Regulation concentrate on the exemption from \\nliability of providers of intermediary services, it is important to recall that, despite the \\ngenerally important role played by those providers, the problem of illegal content and \\nactivities online should not be dealt with by solely focusing on their liability and \\nresponsibilities. Where possible, third parties affected by illegal content transmitted or \\nstored online should attempt to resolve conflicts relating to such content without \\ninvolving the providers of intermediary services in question. Recipients of the service \\nshould be held liable, where the applicable rules of Union and national law \\ndetermining such liability so provide, for the illegal content that they provide and may \\ndisseminate through intermediary services. Where appropriate, other actors, such as \\ngroup moderators in closed online environments, in particular in the case of large \\ngroups, should also help to avoid the spread of illegal content online, in accordance \\nwith the applicable law. Furthermore, where it is necessary to involve information \\nsociety services providers, including providers of intermediary services, any requests \\nor orders for such involvement should, as a general rule, be directed to the actor that \\nhas the technical and operational ability to act against specific items of illegal content, \\nso as to prevent and minimise any possible negative effects for the availability and \\naccessibility of information that is not illegal content. \\n(27) \\nSince 2000, new technologies have emerged that improve the availability, efficiency, \\nspeed, reliability, capacity and security of systems for the transmission and storage of \\ndata online, leading to an increasingly complex online ecosystem. In this regard, it \\nshould be recalled that providers of services establishing and facilitating the \\nunderlying logical architecture and proper functioning of the internet, including \\ntechnical auxiliary functions, can also benefit from the exemptions from liability set \\nout in this Regulation, to the extent that their services qualify as \\u2018mere conduits\\u2019, \\n EN \\n24 \\n EN \\n\\u2018caching\\u2019 or hosting services. Such services include, as the case may be, wireless local \\narea networks, domain name system (DNS) services, top\\u2013level domain name \\nregistries, certificate authorities that issue digital certificates, or content delivery \\nnetworks, that enable or improve the functions of other providers of intermediary \\nservices. Likewise, services used for communications purposes, and the technical \\nmeans of their delivery, have also evolved considerably, giving rise to online services \\nsuch as Voice over IP, messaging services and web-based e-mail services, where the \\ncommunication is delivered via an internet access service. Those services, too, can \\nbenefit from the exemptions from liability, to the extent that they qualify as \\u2018mere \\nconduit\\u2019, \\u2018caching\\u2019 or hosting service.  \\n(28) \\nProviders of intermediary services should not be subject to a monitoring obligation \\nwith respect to obligations of a general nature. This does not concern monitoring \\nobligations in a specific case and, in particular, does not affect orders by national \\nauthorities in accordance with national legislation, in accordance with the conditions \\nestablished in this Regulation. Nothing in this Regulation should be construed as an \\nimposition of a general monitoring obligation or active fact-finding obligation, or as a \\ngeneral obligation for providers to take proactive measures to relation to illegal \\ncontent.  \\n(29) \\nDepending on the legal system of each Member State and the field of law at issue, \\nnational judicial or administrative authorities may order providers of intermediary \\nservices to act against certain specific items of illegal content or to provide certain \\nspecific items of information. The national laws on the basis of which such orders are \\nissued differ considerably and the orders are increasingly addressed in cross-border \\nsituations. In order to ensure that those orders can be complied with in an effective and \\nefficient manner, so that the public authorities concerned can carry out their tasks and \\nthe providers are not subject to any disproportionate burdens, without unduly affecting \\nthe rights and legitimate interests of any third parties, it is necessary to set certain \\nconditions that those orders should meet and certain complementary requirements \\nrelating to the processing of those orders.  \\n(30) \\nOrders to act against illegal content or to provide information should be issued in \\ncompliance with Union law, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and the \\nprohibition of general obligations to monitor information or to actively seek facts or \\ncircumstances indicating illegal activity laid down in this Regulation. The conditions \\nand requirements laid down in this Regulation which apply to orders to act against \\nillegal content are without prejudice to other Union acts providing for similar systems \\nfor acting against specific types of illegal content, such as Regulation (EU) \\u2026/\\u2026. \\n[proposed Regulation addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online], or \\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2394 that confers specific powers to order the provision of \\ninformation on Member State consumer law enforcement authorities, whilst the \\nconditions and requirements that apply to orders to provide information are without \\nprejudice to other Union acts providing for similar relevant rules for specific sectors. \\nThose conditions and requirements should be without prejudice to retention and \\npreservation rules under applicable national law, in conformity with Union law and \\nconfidentiality requests by law enforcement authorities related to the non-disclosure of \\ninformation. \\n(31) \\nThe territorial scope of such orders to act against illegal content should be clearly set \\nout on the basis of the applicable Union or national law enabling the issuance of the \\norder and should not exceed what is strictly necessary to achieve its objectives. In that \\nregard, the national judicial or administrative authority issuing the order should \\n EN \\n25 \\n EN \\nbalance the objective that the order seeks to achieve, in accordance with the legal basis \\nenabling its issuance, with the rights and legitimate interests of all third parties that \\nmay be affected by the order, in particular their fundamental rights under the Charter. \\nIn addition, where the order referring to the specific information may have effects \\nbeyond the territory of the Member State of the authority concerned, the authority \\nshould assess whether the information at issue is likely to constitute illegal content in \\nother Member States concerned and, where relevant, take account of the relevant rules \\nof Union law or international law and the interests of international comity. \\n(32) \\nThe orders to provide information regulated by this Regulation concern the production \\nof specific information about individual recipients of the intermediary service \\nconcerned who are identified in those orders for the purposes of determining \\ncompliance by the recipients of the services with applicable Union or national rules. \\nTherefore, orders about information on a group of recipients of the service who are not \\nspecifically identified, including orders to provide aggregate information required for \\nstatistical purposes or evidence-based policy-making, should remain unaffected by the \\nrules of this Regulation on the provision of information.  \\n(33) \\nOrders to act against illegal content and to provide information are subject to the rules \\nsafeguarding the competence of the Member State where the service provider \\naddressed is established and laying down possible derogations from that competence \\nin certain cases, set out in Article 3 of Directive 2000/31/EC, only if the conditions of \\nthat Article are met. Given that the orders in question relate to specific items of illegal \\ncontent and information, respectively, where they are addressed to providers of \\nintermediary services established in another Member State, they do not in principle \\nrestrict those providers\\u2019 freedom to provide their services across borders. Therefore, \\nthe rules set out in Article 3 of Directive 2000/31/EC, including those regarding the \\nneed to justify measures derogating from the competence of the Member State where \\nthe service provider is established on certain specified grounds and regarding the \\nnotification of such measures, do not apply in respect of those orders. \\n(34) \\nIn order to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, and in particular to improve the \\nfunctioning of the internal market and ensure a safe and transparent online \\nenvironment, it is necessary to establish a clear and balanced set of harmonised due \\ndiligence obligations for providers of intermediary services. Those obligations should \\naim in particular to guarantee different public policy objectives such as the safety and \\ntrust of the recipients of the service, including minors and vulnerable users, protect the \\nrelevant fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, to ensure meaningful \\naccountability of those providers and to empower recipients and other affected parties, \\nwhilst facilitating the necessary oversight by competent authorities. \\n(35) \\nIn that regard, it is important that the due diligence obligations are adapted to the type \\nand nature of the intermediary service concerned. This Regulation therefore sets out \\nbasic obligations applicable to all providers of intermediary services, as well as \\nadditional obligations for providers of hosting services and, more specifically, online \\nplatforms and very large online platforms. To the extent that providers of intermediary \\nservices may fall within those different categories in view of the nature of their \\nservices and their size, they should comply with all of the corresponding obligations of \\nthis Regulation. Those harmonised due diligence obligations, which should be \\nreasonable and non-arbitrary, are needed to achieve the identified public policy \\nconcerns, such as safeguarding the legitimate interests of the recipients of the service, \\naddressing illegal practices and protecting fundamental rights online.  \\n EN \\n26 \\n EN \\n(36) \\nIn order to facilitate smooth and efficient communications relating to matters covered \\nby this Regulation, providers of intermediary services should be required to establish a \\nsingle point of contact and to publish relevant information relating to their point of \\ncontact, including the languages to be used in such communications. The point of \\ncontact can also be used by trusted flaggers and by professional entities which are \\nunder a specific relationship with the provider of intermediary services. In contrast to \\nthe legal representative, the point of contact should serve operational purposes and \\nshould not necessarily have to have a physical location . \\n(37) \\nProviders of intermediary services that are established in a third country that offer \\nservices in the Union should designate a sufficiently mandated legal representative in \\nthe Union and provide information relating to their legal representatives, so as to allow \\nfor the effective oversight and, where necessary, enforcement of this Regulation in \\nrelation to those providers. It should be possible for the legal representative to also \\nfunction as point of contact, provided the relevant requirements of this Regulation are \\ncomplied with.  \\n(38) \\nWhilst the freedom of contract of providers of intermediary services should in \\nprinciple be respected, it is appropriate to set certain rules on the content, application \\nand enforcement of the terms and conditions of those providers in the interests of \\ntransparency, the protection of recipients of the service and the avoidance of unfair or \\narbitrary outcomes. \\n(39) \\nTo ensure an adequate level of transparency and accountability, providers of \\nintermediary services should annually report, in accordance with the harmonised \\nrequirements contained in this Regulation, on the content moderation they engage in, \\nincluding the measures taken as a result of the application and enforcement of their \\nterms and conditions. However, so as to avoid disproportionate burdens, those \\ntransparency reporting obligations should not apply to providers that are micro- or \\nsmall enterprises as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC.40 \\n(40) \\nProviders of hosting services play a particularly important role in tackling illegal \\ncontent online, as they store information provided by and at the request of the \\nrecipients of the service and typically give other recipients access thereto, sometimes \\non a large scale. It is important that all providers of hosting services, regardless of \\ntheir size, put in place user-friendly notice and action mechanisms that facilitate the \\nnotification of specific items of information that the notifying party considers to be \\nillegal content to the provider of hosting services concerned ('notice'), pursuant to \\nwhich that provider can decide whether or not it agrees with that assessment and \\nwishes to remove or disable access to that content ('action'). Provided the requirements \\non notices are met, it should be possible for individuals or entities to notify multiple \\nspecific items of allegedly illegal content through a single notice. The obligation to put \\nin place notice and action mechanisms should apply, for instance, to file storage and \\nsharing services, web hosting services, advertising servers and paste bins, in as far as \\nthey qualify as providers of hosting services covered by this Regulation.  \\n(41) \\nThe rules on such notice and action mechanisms should be harmonised at Union level, \\nso as to provide for the timely, diligent and objective processing of notices on the basis \\nof rules that are uniform, transparent and clear and that provide for robust safeguards \\nto protect the right and legitimate interests of all affected parties, in particular their \\n                                                 \\n40 Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and \\nmedium-sized enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36). \\n EN \\n27 \\n EN \\nfundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, irrespective of the Member State in \\nwhich those parties are established or reside and of the field of law at issue. The \\nfundamental rights include, as the case may be, the right to freedom of expression and \\ninformation, the right to respect for private and family life, the right to protection of \\npersonal data, the right to non-discrimination and the right to an effective remedy of \\nthe recipients of the service; the freedom to conduct a business, including the freedom \\nof contract, of service providers; as well as the right to human dignity, the rights of the \\nchild, the right to protection of property, including intellectual property, and the right \\nto non-discrimination of parties affected by illegal content.  \\n(42) \\nWhere a hosting service provider decides to remove or disable information provided \\nby a recipient of the service, for instance following receipt of a notice or acting on its \\nown initiative, including through the use of automated means, that provider should \\ninform the recipient of its decision, the reasons for its decision and the available \\nredress possibilities to contest the decision, in view of the negative consequences that \\nsuch decisions may have for the recipient, including as regards the exercise of its \\nfundamental right to freedom of expression. That obligation should apply irrespective \\nof the reasons for the decision, in particular whether the action has been taken because \\nthe information notified is considered to be illegal content or incompatible with the \\napplicable terms and conditions. Available recourses to challenge the decision of the \\nhosting service provider should always include judicial redress.  \\n(43) \\nTo avoid disproportionate burdens, the additional obligations imposed on online \\nplatforms under this Regulation should not apply to micro or small enterprises as \\ndefined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC of the Commission,41 unless their reach and \\nimpact is such that they meet the criteria to qualify as very large online platforms \\nunder this Regulation. The consolidation rules laid down in that Recommendation help \\nensure that any circumvention of those additional obligations is prevented. The \\nexemption of micro- and small enterprises from those additional obligations should \\nnot be understood as affecting their ability to set up, on a voluntary basis, a system that \\ncomplies with one or more of those obligations. \\n(44) \\nRecipients of the service should be able to easily and effectively contest certain \\ndecisions of online platforms that negatively affect them. Therefore, online platforms \\nshould be required to provide for internal complaint-handling systems, which meet \\ncertain conditions aimed at ensuring that the systems are easily accessible and lead to \\nswift and fair outcomes. In addition, provision should be made for the possibility of \\nout-of-court dispute settlement of disputes, including those that could not be resolved \\nin satisfactory manner through the internal complaint-handling systems, by certified \\nbodies that have the requisite independence, means and expertise to carry out their \\nactivities in a fair, swift and cost-effective manner. The possibilities to contest \\ndecisions of online platforms thus created should complement, yet leave unaffected in \\nall respects, the possibility to seek judicial redress in accordance with the laws of the \\nMember State concerned. \\n(45) \\nFor contractual consumer-to-business disputes over the purchase of goods or services, \\nDirective 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council42 ensures that \\n                                                 \\n41 Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and \\nmedium-sized enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36). \\n42 Directive 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute \\nresolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (OJ \\nL 165, 18.6.2013, p. 63).  \\n EN \\n28 \\n EN \\nUnion consumers and businesses in the Union have access to quality-certified \\nalternative dispute resolution entities. In this regard, it should be clarified that the rules \\nof this Regulation on out-of-court dispute settlement are without prejudice to that \\nDirective, including the right of consumers under that Directive to withdraw from the \\nprocedure at any stage if they are dissatisfied with the performance or the operation of \\nthe procedure.  \\n(46) \\nAction against illegal content can be taken more quickly and reliably where online \\nplatforms take the necessary measures to ensure that notices submitted by trusted \\nflaggers through the notice and action mechanisms required by this Regulation are \\ntreated with priority, without prejudice to the requirement to process and decide upon \\nall notices submitted under those mechanisms in a timely, diligent and objective \\nmanner. Such trusted flagger status should only be awarded to entities, and not \\nindividuals, that have demonstrated, among other things, that they have particular \\nexpertise and competence in tackling illegal content, that they represent collective \\ninterests and that they work in a diligent and objective manner. Such entities can be \\npublic in nature, such as, for terrorist content, internet referral units of national law \\nenforcement authorities or of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement \\nCooperation (\\u2018Europol\\u2019) or they can be non-governmental organisations and semi-\\npublic bodies, such as the organisations part of the INHOPE network of hotlines for \\nreporting child sexual abuse material and organisations committed to notifying illegal \\nracist and xenophobic expressions online. For intellectual property rights, \\norganisations of industry and of right-holders could be awarded trusted flagger status, \\nwhere they have demonstrated that they meet the applicable conditions. The rules of \\nthis Regulation on trusted flaggers should not be understood to prevent online \\nplatforms from giving similar treatment to notices submitted by entities or individuals \\nthat have not been awarded trusted flagger status under this Regulation, from \\notherwise cooperating with other entities, in accordance with the applicable law, \\nincluding this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament \\nand of the Council.43  \\n(47) \\nThe misuse of services of online platforms by frequently providing manifestly illegal \\ncontent or by frequently submitting manifestly unfounded notices or complaints under \\nthe mechanisms and systems, respectively, established under this Regulation \\nundermines trust and harms the rights and legitimate interests of the parties concerned. \\nTherefore, there is a need to put in place appropriate and proportionate safeguards \\nagainst such misuse. Information should be considered to be manifestly illegal content \\nand notices or complaints should be considered manifestly unfounded where it is \\nevident to a layperson, without any substantive analysis, that the content is illegal \\nrespectively that the notices or complaints are unfounded. Under certain conditions, \\nonline platforms should temporarily suspend their relevant activities in respect of the \\nperson engaged in abusive behaviour. This is without prejudice to the freedom by \\nonline platforms to determine their terms and conditions and establish stricter \\nmeasures in the case of manifestly illegal content related to serious crimes. For reasons \\nof transparency, this possibility should be set out, clearly and in sufficiently detail, in \\nthe terms and conditions of the online platforms. Redress should always be open to the \\ndecisions taken in this regard by online platforms and they should be subject to \\n                                                 \\n43 Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the European \\nUnion Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and replacing and repealing Council Decisions \\n2009/371/JHA, 2009/934/JHA, 2009/935/JHA, 2009/936/JHA and 2009/968/JHA, OJ L 135, 24.5.2016, p. 53 \\n EN \\n29 \\n EN \\noversight by the competent Digital Services Coordinator. The rules of this Regulation \\non misuse should not prevent online platforms from taking other measures to address \\nthe provision of illegal content by recipients of their service or other misuse of their \\nservices, in accordance with the applicable Union and national law. Those rules are \\nwithout prejudice to any possibility to hold the persons engaged in misuse liable, \\nincluding for damages, provided for in Union or national law.  \\n(48) \\nAn online platform may in some instances become aware, such as through a notice by \\na notifying party or through its own voluntary measures, of information relating to \\ncertain activity of a recipient of the service, such as the provision of certain types of \\nillegal content, that reasonably justify, having regard to all relevant circumstances of \\nwhich the online platform is aware, the suspicion that the recipient may have \\ncommitted, may be committing or is likely to commit a serious criminal offence \\ninvolving a threat to the life or safety of person, such as offences specified in Directive \\n2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council44. In such instances, the \\nonline platform should inform without delay the competent law enforcement \\nauthorities of such suspicion, providing all relevant information available to it, \\nincluding where relevant the content in question and an explanation of its suspicion. \\nThis Regulation does not provide the legal basis for profiling of recipients of the \\nservices with a view to the possible identification of criminal offences by online \\nplatforms. Online platforms should also respect other applicable rules of Union or \\nnational law for the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals when \\ninforming law enforcement authorities.  \\n(49) \\nIn order to contribute to a safe, trustworthy and transparent online environment for \\nconsumers, as well as for other interested parties such as competing traders and \\nholders of intellectual property rights, and to deter traders from selling products or \\nservices in violation of the applicable rules, online platforms allowing consumers to \\nconclude distance contracts with traders should ensure that such traders are traceable. \\nThe trader should therefore be required to provide certain essential information to the \\nonline platform, including for purposes of promoting messages on or offering \\nproducts. That requirement should also be applicable to traders that promote messages \\non products or services on behalf of brands, based on underlying agreements. Those \\nonline platforms should store all information in a secure manner for a reasonable \\nperiod of time that does not exceed what is necessary, so that it can be accessed, in \\naccordance with the applicable law, including on the protection of personal data, by \\npublic authorities and private parties with a legitimate interest, including through the \\norders to provide information referred to in this Regulation.  \\n(50) \\nTo ensure an efficient and adequate application of that obligation, without imposing \\nany disproportionate burdens, the online platforms covered should make reasonable \\nefforts to verify the reliability of the information provided by the traders concerned, in \\nparticular by using freely available official online databases and online interfaces, such \\nas national trade registers and the VAT Information Exchange System45, or by \\nrequesting the traders concerned to provide trustworthy supporting documents, such as \\ncopies of identity documents, certified bank statements, company certificates and trade \\nregister certificates. They may also use other sources, available for use at a distance, \\n                                                 \\n44 Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the \\nsexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework \\nDecision 2004/68/JHA (OJ L 335, 17.12.2011, p. 1).  \\n45 https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/vieshome.do?selectedLanguage=en  \\n EN \\n30 \\n EN \\nwhich offer a similar degree of reliability for the purpose of complying with this \\nobligation. However, the online platforms covered should not be required to engage in \\nexcessive or costly online fact-finding exercises or to carry out verifications on the \\nspot. Nor should such online platforms, which have made the reasonable efforts \\nrequired by this Regulation, be understood as guaranteeing the reliability of the \\ninformation towards consumer or other interested parties. Such online platforms \\nshould also design and organise their online interface in a way that enables traders to \\ncomply with their obligations under Union law, in particular the requirements set out \\nin Articles 6 and 8 of Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil46, Article 7 of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil47 and Article 3 of Directive 98/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil48. \\n(51) \\nIn view of the particular responsibilities and obligations of online platforms, they \\nshould be made subject to transparency reporting obligations, which apply in addition \\nto the transparency reporting obligations applicable to all providers of intermediary \\nservices under this Regulation. For the purposes of determining whether online \\nplatforms may be very large online platforms that are subject to certain additional \\nobligations under this Regulation, the transparency reporting obligations for online \\nplatforms should include certain obligations relating to the publication and \\ncommunication of information on the average monthly active recipients of the service \\nin the Union.  \\n(52) \\nOnline advertisement plays an important role in the online environment, including in \\nrelation to the provision of the services of online platforms. However, online \\nadvertisement can contribute to significant risks, ranging from advertisement that is \\nitself illegal content, to contributing to financial incentives for the publication or \\namplification of illegal or otherwise harmful content and activities online, or the \\ndiscriminatory display of advertising with an impact on the equal treatment and \\nopportunities of citizens. In addition to the requirements resulting from Article 6 of \\nDirective 2000/31/EC, online platforms should therefore be required to ensure that the \\nrecipients of the service have certain individualised information necessary for them to \\nunderstand when and on whose behalf the advertisement is displayed. In addition, \\nrecipients of the service should have information on the main parameters used for \\ndetermining that specific advertising is to be displayed to them, providing meaningful \\nexplanations of the logic used to that end, including when this is based on profiling. \\nThe requirements of this Regulation on the provision of information relating to \\nadvertisement is without prejudice to the application of the relevant provisions of \\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular those regarding the right to object, automated \\nindividual decision-making, including profiling and specifically the need to obtain \\n                                                 \\n46 Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, \\namending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil and repealing Council Directive 85/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of \\nthe Council \\n47 Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair \\nbusiness-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive \\n84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \\nand Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (\\u2018Unfair Commercial \\nPractices Directive\\u2019) \\n48 Directive 98/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 on consumer protection \\nin the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers \\n EN \\n31 \\n EN \\nconsent of the data subject prior to the processing of personal data for targeted \\nadvertising. Similarly, it is without prejudice to the provisions laid down in Directive \\n2002/58/EC in particular those regarding the storage of information in terminal \\nequipment and the access to information stored therein.   \\n(53) \\nGiven the importance of very large online platforms, due to their reach, in particular as \\nexpressed in number of recipients of the service, in facilitating public debate, \\neconomic transactions and the dissemination of information, opinions and ideas and in \\ninfluencing how recipients obtain and communicate information online, it is necessary \\nto impose specific obligations on those platforms, in addition to the obligations \\napplicable to all online platforms. Those additional obligations on very large online \\nplatforms are necessary to address those public policy concerns, there being no \\nalternative and less restrictive measures that would effectively achieve the same result. \\n(54) \\nVery large online platforms may cause societal risks, different in scope and impact \\nfrom those caused by smaller platforms. Once the number of recipients of a platform \\nreaches a significant share of the Union population, the systemic risks the platform \\nposes have a disproportionately negative impact in the Union. Such significant reach \\nshould be considered to exist where the number of recipients exceeds an operational \\nthreshold set at 45 million, that is, a number equivalent to 10% of the Union \\npopulation. The operational threshold should be kept up to date through amendments \\nenacted by delegated acts, where necessary. Such very large online platforms should \\ntherefore bear the highest standard of due diligence obligations, proportionate to their \\nsocietal impact and means. \\n(55) \\nIn view of the network effects characterising the platform economy, the user base of \\nan online platform may quickly expand and reach the dimension of a very large online \\nplatform, with the related impact on the internal market. This may be the case in the \\nevent of exponential growth experienced in short periods of time, or by a large global \\npresence and turnover allowing the online platform to fully exploit network effects and \\neconomies of scale and of scope. A high annual turnover or market capitalisation can \\nin particular be an indication of fast scalability in terms of user reach. In those cases, \\nthe Digital Services Coordinator should be able to request more frequent reporting \\nfrom the platform on the user base to be able to timely identify the moment at which \\nthat platform should be designated as a very large online platform for the purposes of \\nthis Regulation.  \\n(56) \\nVery large online platforms are used in a way that strongly influences safety online, \\nthe shaping of public opinion and discourse, as well as on online trade. The way they \\ndesign their services is generally optimised to benefit their often advertising-driven \\nbusiness models and can cause societal concerns. In the absence of effective regulation \\nand enforcement, they can set the rules of the game, without effectively identifying \\nand mitigating the risks and the societal and economic harm they can cause. Under this \\nRegulation, very large online platforms should therefore assess the systemic risks \\nstemming from the functioning and use of their service, as well as by potential misuses \\nby the recipients of the service, and take appropriate mitigating measures.  \\n(57) \\nThree categories of systemic risks should be assessed in-depth. A first category \\nconcerns the risks associated with the misuse of their service through the \\ndissemination of illegal content, such as the dissemination of child sexual abuse \\nmaterial or illegal hate speech, and the conduct of illegal activities, such as the sale of \\nproducts or services prohibited by Union or national law, including counterfeit \\nproducts. For example, and without prejudice to the personal responsibility of the \\n EN \\n32 \\n EN \\nrecipient of the service of very large online platforms for possible illegality of his or \\nher activity under the applicable law, such dissemination or activities may constitute a \\nsignificant systematic risk where access to such content may be amplified through \\naccounts with a particularly wide reach. A second category concerns the impact of the \\nservice on the exercise of fundamental rights, as protected by the Charter of \\nFundamental Rights, including the freedom of expression and information, the right to \\nprivate life, the right to non-discrimination and the rights of the child. Such risks may \\narise, for example, in relation to the design of the algorithmic systems used by the very \\nlarge online platform or the misuse of their service through the submission of abusive \\nnotices or other methods for silencing speech or hampering competition. A third \\ncategory of risks concerns the intentional and, oftentimes, coordinated manipulation of \\nthe platform\\u2019s service, with a foreseeable impact on health, civic discourse, electoral \\nprocesses, public security and protection of minors, having regard to the need to \\nsafeguard public order, protect privacy and fight fraudulent and deceptive commercial \\npractices. Such risks may arise, for example, through the creation of fake accounts, the \\nuse of bots, and other automated or partially automated behaviours, which may lead to \\nthe rapid and widespread dissemination of information that is illegal content or \\nincompatible with an online platform\\u2019s terms and conditions. \\n(58) \\nVery large online platforms should deploy the necessary means to diligently mitigate \\nthe systemic risks identified in the risk assessment. Very large online platforms should \\nunder such mitigating measures consider, for example, enhancing or otherwise \\nadapting the design and functioning of their content moderation, algorithmic \\nrecommender systems and online interfaces, so that they discourage and limit the \\ndissemination of illegal content, adapting their decision-making processes, or adapting \\ntheir terms and conditions. They may also include corrective measures, such as \\ndiscontinuing advertising revenue for specific content, or other actions, such as \\nimproving the visibility of authoritative information sources. Very large online \\nplatforms may reinforce their internal processes or supervision of any of their \\nactivities, in particular as regards the detection of systemic risks. They may also \\ninitiate or increase cooperation with trusted flaggers, organise training sessions and \\nexchanges with trusted flagger organisations, and cooperate with other service \\nproviders, including by initiating or joining existing codes of conduct or other self-\\nregulatory measures. Any measures adopted should respect the due diligence \\nrequirements of this Regulation and be effective and appropriate for mitigating the \\nspecific risks identified, in the interest of safeguarding public order, protecting privacy \\nand fighting fraudulent and deceptive commercial practices, and should be \\nproportionate in light of the very large online platform\\u2019s economic capacity and the \\nneed to avoid unnecessary restrictions on the use of their service, taking due account \\nof potential negative effects on the fundamental rights of the recipients of the service.  \\n(59) \\nVery large online platforms should, where appropriate, conduct their risk assessments \\nand design their risk mitigation measures with the involvement of representatives of \\nthe recipients of the service, representatives of groups potentially impacted by their \\nservices, independent experts and civil society organisations.  \\n(60) \\nGiven the need to ensure verification by independent experts, very large online \\nplatforms should be accountable, through independent auditing, for their compliance \\nwith the obligations laid down by this Regulation and, where relevant, any \\ncomplementary commitments undertaking pursuant to codes of conduct and crises \\nprotocols. They should give the auditor access to all relevant data necessary to perform \\nthe audit properly. Auditors should also be able to make use of other sources of \\n EN \\n33 \\n EN \\nobjective information, including studies by vetted researchers. Auditors should \\nguarantee the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information, such as trade \\nsecrets, that they obtain when performing their tasks and have the necessary expertise \\nin the area of risk management and technical competence to audit algorithms. Auditors \\nshould be independent, so as to be able to perform their tasks in an adequate and \\ntrustworthy manner. If their independence is not beyond doubt, they should resign or \\nabstain from the audit engagement.  \\n(61) \\nThe audit report should be substantiated, so as to give a meaningful account of the \\nactivities undertaken and the conclusions reached. It should help inform, and where \\nappropriate suggest improvements to the measures taken by the very large online \\nplatform to comply with their obligations under this Regulation. The report should be \\ntransmitted to the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment and the Board without \\ndelay, together with the risk assessment and the mitigation measures, as well as the \\nplatform\\u2019s plans for addressing the audit\\u2019s recommendations. The report should \\ninclude an audit opinion based on the conclusions drawn from the audit evidence \\nobtained. A positive opinion should be given where all evidence shows that the very \\nlarge online platform complies with the obligations laid down by this Regulation or, \\nwhere applicable, any commitments it has undertaken pursuant to a code of conduct or \\ncrisis protocol, in particular by identifying, evaluating and mitigating the systemic \\nrisks posed by its system and services. A positive opinion should be accompanied by \\ncomments where the auditor wishes to include remarks that do not have a substantial \\neffect on the outcome of the audit. A negative opinion should be given where the \\nauditor considers that the very large online platform does not comply with this \\nRegulation or the commitments undertaken.  \\n(62) \\nA core part of a very large online platform\\u2019s business is the manner in which \\ninformation is prioritised and presented on its online interface to facilitate and \\noptimise access to information for the recipients of the service. This is done, for \\nexample, by algorithmically suggesting, ranking and prioritising information, \\ndistinguishing through text or other visual representations, or otherwise curating \\ninformation provided by recipients. Such recommender systems can have a significant \\nimpact on the ability of recipients to retrieve and interact with information online. \\nThey also play an important role in the amplification of certain messages, the viral \\ndissemination of information and the stimulation of online behaviour. Consequently, \\nvery large online platforms should ensure that recipients are appropriately informed, \\nand can influence the information presented to them. They should clearly present the \\nmain parameters for such recommender systems in an easily comprehensible manner \\nto ensure that the recipients understand how information is prioritised for them. They \\nshould also ensure that the recipients enjoy alternative options for the main \\nparameters, including options that are not based on profiling of the recipient.  \\n(63) \\nAdvertising systems used by very large online platforms pose particular risks and \\nrequire further public and regulatory supervision on account of their scale and ability \\nto target and reach recipients of the service based on their behaviour within and \\noutside that platform\\u2019s online interface. Very large online platforms should ensure \\npublic access to repositories of advertisements displayed on their online interfaces to \\nfacilitate supervision and research into emerging risks brought about by the \\ndistribution of advertising online, for example in relation to illegal advertisements or \\nmanipulative techniques and disinformation with a real and foreseeable negative \\nimpact on public health, public security, civil discourse, political participation and \\nequality. Repositories should include the content of advertisements and related data on \\n EN \\n34 \\n EN \\nthe advertiser and the delivery of the advertisement, in particular where targeted \\nadvertising is concerned.  \\n(64) \\nIn order to appropriately supervise the compliance of very large online platforms with \\nthe obligations laid down by this Regulation, the Digital Services Coordinator of \\nestablishment or the Commission may require access to or reporting of specific data. \\nSuch a requirement may include, for example, the data necessary to assess the risks \\nand possible harms brought about by the platform\\u2019s systems, data on the accuracy, \\nfunctioning and testing of algorithmic systems for content moderation, recommender \\nsystems or advertising systems, or data on processes and outputs of content \\nmoderation or of internal complaint-handling systems within the meaning of this \\nRegulation. Investigations by researchers on the evolution and severity of online \\nsystemic risks are particularly important for bridging information asymmetries and \\nestablishing a resilient system of risk mitigation, informing online platforms, Digital \\nServices Coordinators, other competent authorities, the Commission and the public. \\nThis Regulation therefore provides a framework for compelling access to data from \\nvery large online platforms to vetted researchers. All requirements for access to data \\nunder that framework should be proportionate and appropriately protect the rights and \\nlegitimate interests, including trade secrets and other confidential information, of the \\nplatform and any other parties concerned, including the recipients of the service. \\n(65) \\nGiven the complexity of the functioning of the systems deployed and the systemic \\nrisks they present to society, very large online platforms should appoint compliance \\nofficers, which should have the necessary qualifications to operationalise measures \\nand monitor the compliance with this Regulation within the platform\\u2019s organisation. \\nVery large online platforms should ensure that the compliance officer is involved, \\nproperly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to this Regulation. In view \\nof the additional risks relating to their activities and their additional obligations under \\nthis Regulation, the other transparency requirements set out in this Regulation should \\nbe complemented by additional transparency requirements applicable specifically to \\nvery large online platforms, notably to report on the risk assessments performed and \\nsubsequent measures adopted as provided by this Regulation.  \\n(66) \\nTo facilitate the effective and consistent application of the obligations in this \\nRegulation that may require implementation through technological means, it is \\nimportant to promote voluntary industry standards covering certain technical \\nprocedures, where the industry can help develop standardised means to comply with \\nthis Regulation, such as allowing the submission of notices, including through \\napplication programming interfaces, or about the interoperability of advertisement \\nrepositories. Such standards could in particular be useful for relatively small providers \\nof intermediary services. The standards could distinguish between different types of \\nillegal content or different types of intermediary services, as appropriate. \\n(67) \\nThe Commission and the Board should encourage the drawing-up of codes of conduct \\nto contribute to the application of this Regulation. While the implementation of codes \\nof conduct should be measurable and subject to public oversight, this should not \\nimpair the voluntary nature of such codes and the freedom of interested parties to \\ndecide whether to participate. In certain circumstances, it is important that very large \\nonline platforms cooperate in the drawing-up and adhere to specific codes of conduct. \\nNothing in this Regulation prevents other service providers from adhering to the same \\nstandards of due diligence, adopting best practices and benefitting from the guidance \\nprovided by the Commission and the Board, by participating in the same codes of \\nconduct. \\n EN \\n35 \\n EN \\n(68) \\nIt is appropriate that this Regulation identify certain areas of consideration for such \\ncodes of conduct. In particular, risk mitigation measures concerning specific types of \\nillegal content should be explored via self- and co-regulatory agreements. Another \\narea for consideration is the possible negative impacts of systemic risks on society and \\ndemocracy, such as disinformation or manipulative and abusive activities. This \\nincludes coordinated operations aimed at amplifying information, including \\ndisinformation, such as the use of bots or fake accounts for the creation of fake or \\nmisleading information, sometimes with a purpose of obtaining economic gain, which \\nare particularly harmful for vulnerable recipients of the service, such as children. In \\nrelation to such areas, adherence to and compliance with a given code of conduct by a \\nvery large online platform may be considered as an appropriate risk mitigating \\nmeasure. The refusal without proper explanations by an online platform of the \\nCommission\\u2019s invitation to participate in the application of such a code of conduct \\ncould be taken into account, where relevant, when determining whether the online \\nplatform has infringed the obligations laid down by this Regulation. \\n(69) \\nThe rules on codes of conduct under this Regulation could serve as a basis for already \\nestablished self-regulatory efforts at Union level, including the Product Safety Pledge, \\nthe Memorandum of Understanding against counterfeit goods, the Code of Conduct \\nagainst illegal hate speech as well as the Code of practice on disinformation. In \\nparticular for the latter, the Commission will issue guidance for strengthening the \\nCode of practice on disinformation as announced in the European Democracy Action \\nPlan. \\n(70) \\nThe provision of online advertising generally involves several actors, including \\nintermediary services that connect publishers of advertising with advertisers. Codes of \\nconducts should support and complement the transparency obligations relating to \\nadvertisement for online platforms and very large online platforms set out in this \\nRegulation in order to provide for flexible and effective mechanisms to facilitate and \\nenhance the compliance with those obligations, notably as concerns the modalities of \\nthe transmission of the relevant information. The involvement of a wide range of \\nstakeholders should ensure that those codes of conduct are widely supported, \\ntechnically sound, effective and offer the highest levels of user-friendliness to ensure \\nthat the transparency obligations achieve their objectives. \\n(71) \\nIn case of extraordinary circumstances affecting public security or public health, the \\nCommission may initiate the drawing up of crisis protocols to coordinate a rapid, \\ncollective and cross-border response in the online environment. Extraordinary \\ncircumstances may entail any unforeseeable event, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, \\npandemics and other serious cross-border threats to public health, war and acts of \\nterrorism, where, for example, online platforms may be misused for the rapid spread of \\nillegal content or disinformation or where the need arises for rapid dissemination of \\nreliable information. In light of the important role of very large online platforms in \\ndisseminating information in our societies and across borders, such platforms should \\nbe encouraged in drawing up and applying specific crisis protocols. Such crisis \\nprotocols should be activated only for a limited period of time and the measures \\nadopted should also be limited to what is strictly necessary to address the \\nextraordinary circumstance. Those measures should be consistent with this Regulation, \\nand should not amount to a general obligation for the participating very large online \\nplatforms to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor actively to seek \\nfacts or circumstances indicating illegal content.  \\n EN \\n36 \\n EN \\n(72) \\nThe task of ensuring adequate oversight and enforcement of the obligations laid down \\nin this Regulation should in principle be attributed to the Member States. To this end, \\nthey should appoint at least one authority with the task to apply and enforce this \\nRegulation. Member States should however be able to entrust more than one \\ncompetent authority, with specific supervisory or enforcement tasks and competences \\nconcerning the application of this Regulation, for example for specific sectors, such as \\nelectronic communications\\u2019 regulators, media regulators or consumer protection \\nauthorities, reflecting their domestic constitutional, organisational and administrative \\nstructure.  \\n(73) \\nGiven the cross-border nature of the services at stake and the horizontal range of \\nobligations introduced by this Regulation, the authority appointed with the task of \\nsupervising the application and, where necessary, enforcing this Regulation should be \\nidentified as a Digital Services Coordinator in each Member State. Where more than \\none competent authority is appointed to apply and enforce this Regulation, only one \\nauthority in that Member State should be identified as a Digital Services Coordinator. \\nThe Digital Services Coordinator should act as the single contact point with regard to \\nall matters related to the application of this Regulation for the Commission, the Board, \\nthe Digital Services Coordinators of other Member States, as well as for other \\ncompetent authorities of the Member State in question. In particular, where several \\ncompetent authorities are entrusted with tasks under this Regulation in a given \\nMember State, the Digital Services Coordinator should coordinate and cooperate with \\nthose authorities in accordance with the national law setting their respective tasks, and \\nshould ensure effective involvement of all relevant authorities in the supervision and \\nenforcement at Union level.  \\n(74) \\nThe Digital Services Coordinator, as well as other competent authorities designated \\nunder this Regulation, play a crucial role in ensuring the effectiveness of the rights and \\nobligations laid down in this Regulation and the achievement of its objectives. \\nAccordingly, it is necessary to ensure that those authorities act in complete \\nindependence from private and public bodies, without the obligation or possibility to \\nseek or receive instructions, including from the government, and without prejudice to \\nthe specific duties to cooperate with other competent authorities, the Digital Services \\nCoordinators, the Board and the Commission. On the other hand, the independence of \\nthese authorities should not mean that they cannot be subject, in accordance with \\nnational constitutions and without endangering the achievement of the objectives of \\nthis Regulation, to national control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial \\nexpenditure or to judicial review, or that they should not have the possibility to consult \\nother national authorities, including law enforcement authorities or crisis management \\nauthorities, where appropriate.  \\n(75) \\nMember States can designate an existing national authority with the function of the \\nDigital Services Coordinator, or with specific tasks to apply and enforce this \\nRegulation, provided that any such appointed authority complies with the \\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation, such as in relation to its independence. \\nMoreover, Member States are in principle not precluded from merging functions \\nwithin an existing authority, in accordance with Union law. The measures to that \\neffect may include, inter alia, the preclusion to dismiss the President or a board \\nmember of a collegiate body of an existing authority before the expiry of their terms of \\noffice, on the sole ground that an institutional reform has taken place involving the \\nmerger of different functions within one authority, in the absence of any rules \\n EN \\n37 \\n EN \\nguaranteeing that such dismissals do not jeopardise the independence and impartiality \\nof such members. \\n(76) \\nIn the absence of a general requirement for providers of intermediary services to \\nensure a physical presence within the territory of one of the Member States, there is a \\nneed to ensure clarity under which Member State's jurisdiction those providers fall for \\nthe purposes of enforcing the rules laid down in Chapters III and IV by the national \\ncompetent authorities. A provider should be under the jurisdiction of the Member \\nState where its main establishment is located, that is, where the provider has its head \\noffice or registered office within which the principal financial functions and \\noperational control are exercised. In respect of providers that do not have an \\nestablishment in the Union but that offer services in the Union and therefore fall \\nwithin the scope of this Regulation, the Member State where those providers \\nappointed their legal representative should have jurisdiction, considering the function \\nof legal representatives under this Regulation. In the interest of the effective \\napplication of this Regulation, all Member States should, however, have jurisdiction in \\nrespect of providers that failed to designate a legal representative, provided that the \\nprinciple of ne bis in idem is respected. To that aim, each Member State that exercises \\njurisdiction in respect of such providers should, without undue delay, inform all other \\nMember States of the measures they have taken in the exercise of that jurisdiction. \\n(77) \\nMember States should provide the Digital Services Coordinator, and any other \\ncompetent authority designated under this Regulation, with sufficient powers and \\nmeans to ensure effective investigation and enforcement. Digital Services \\nCoordinators should in particular be able to search for and obtain information which is \\nlocated in its territory, including in the context of joint investigations, with due regard \\nto the fact that oversight and enforcement measures concerning a provider under the \\njurisdiction of another Member State should be adopted by the Digital Services \\nCoordinator of that other Member State, where relevant in accordance with the \\nprocedures relating to cross-border cooperation. \\n(78) \\nMember States should set out in their national law, in accordance with Union law and \\nin particular this Regulation and the Charter, the detailed conditions and limits for the \\nexercise of the investigatory and enforcement powers of their Digital Services \\nCoordinators, and other competent authorities where relevant, under this Regulation.  \\n(79) \\nIn the course of the exercise of those powers, the competent authorities should comply \\nwith the applicable national rules regarding procedures and matters such as the need \\nfor a prior judicial authorisation to enter certain premises and legal professional \\nprivilege. Those provisions should in particular ensure respect for the fundamental \\nrights to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, including the rights of defence, and, the \\nright to respect for private life. In this regard, the guarantees provided for in relation to \\nthe proceedings of the Commission pursuant to this Regulation could serve as an \\nappropriate point of reference. A prior, fair and impartial procedure should be \\nguaranteed before taking any final decision, including the right to be heard of the \\npersons concerned, and the right to have access to the file, while respecting \\nconfidentiality and professional and business secrecy, as well as the obligation to give \\nmeaningful reasons for the decisions. This should not preclude the taking of measures, \\nhowever, in duly substantiated cases of urgency and subject to appropriate conditions \\nand procedural arrangements. The exercise of powers should also be proportionate to, \\ninter alia the nature and the overall actual or potential harm caused by the infringement \\nor suspected infringement. The competent authorities should in principle take all \\n EN \\n38 \\n EN \\nrelevant facts and circumstances of the case into account, including information \\ngathered by competent authorities in other Member States.  \\n(80) \\nMember States should ensure that violations of the obligations laid down in this \\nRegulation can be sanctioned in a manner that is effective, proportionate and \\ndissuasive, taking into account the nature, gravity, recurrence and duration of the \\nviolation, in view of the public interest pursued, the scope and kind of activities \\ncarried out, as well as the economic capacity of the infringer. In particular, penalties \\nshould take into account whether the provider of intermediary services concerned \\nsystematically or recurrently fails to comply with its obligations stemming from this \\nRegulation, as well as, where relevant, whether the provider is active in several \\nMember States.  \\n(81) \\nIn order to ensure effective enforcement of this Regulation, individuals or \\nrepresentative organisations should be able to lodge any complaint related to \\ncompliance with this Regulation with the Digital Services Coordinator in the territory \\nwhere they received the service, without prejudice to this Regulation\\u2019s rules on \\njurisdiction. Complaints should provide a faithful overview of concerns related to a \\nparticular intermediary service provider\\u2019s compliance and could also inform the \\nDigital Services Coordinator of any more cross-cutting issues. The Digital Services \\nCoordinator should involve other national competent authorities as well as the Digital \\nServices Coordinator of another Member State, and in particular the one of the \\nMember State where the provider of intermediary services concerned is established, if \\nthe issue requires cross-border cooperation. \\n(82) \\nMember States should ensure that Digital Services Coordinators can take measures \\nthat are effective in addressing and proportionate to certain particularly serious and \\npersistent infringements. Especially where those measures can affect the rights and \\ninterests of third parties, as may be the case in particular where the access to online \\ninterfaces is restricted, it is appropriate to require that the measures be ordered by a \\ncompetent judicial authority at the Digital Service Coordinators\\u2019 request and are \\nsubject to additional safeguards. In particular, third parties potentially affected should \\nbe afforded the opportunity to be heard and such orders should only be issued when \\npowers to take such measures as provided by other acts of Union law or by national \\nlaw, for instance to protect collective interests of consumers, to ensure the prompt \\nremoval of web pages containing or disseminating child pornography, or to disable \\naccess to services are being used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property \\nright, are not reasonably available.  \\n(83) \\nSuch an order to restrict access should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its \\nobjective. For that purpose, it should be temporary and be addressed in principle to a \\nprovider of intermediary services, such as the relevant hosting service provider, \\ninternet service provider or domain registry or registrar, which is in a reasonable \\nposition to achieve that objective without unduly restricting access to lawful \\ninformation. \\n(84) \\nThe Digital Services Coordinator should regularly publish a report on the activities \\ncarried out under this Regulation. Given that the Digital Services Coordinator is also \\nmade aware of orders to take action against illegal content or to provide information \\nregulated by this Regulation through the common information sharing system, the \\nDigital Services Coordinator should include in its annual report the number and \\ncategories of these orders addressed to providers of intermediary services issued by \\njudicial and administrative authorities in its Member State. \\n EN \\n39 \\n EN \\n(85) \\nWhere a Digital Services Coordinator requests another Digital Services Coordinator to \\ntake action, the requesting Digital Services Coordinator, or the Board in case it issued \\na recommendation to assess issues involving more than three Member States, should \\nbe able to refer the matter to the Commission in case of any disagreement as to the \\nassessments or the measures taken or proposed or a failure to adopt any measures. The \\nCommission, on the basis of the information made available by the concerned \\nauthorities, should accordingly be able to request the competent Digital Services \\nCoordinator to re-assess the matter and take the necessary measures to ensure \\ncompliance within a defined time period. This possibility is without prejudice to the \\nCommission\\u2019s general duty to oversee the application of, and where necessary enforce, \\nUnion law under the control of the Court of Justice of the European Union in \\naccordance with the Treaties. A failure by the Digital Services Coordinator of \\nestablishment to take any measures pursuant to such a request may also lead to the \\nCommission\\u2019s intervention under Section 3 of Chapter IV of this Regulation, where \\nthe suspected infringer is a very large online platform \\n(86) \\nIn order to facilitate cross-border supervision and investigations involving several \\nMember States, the Digital Services Coordinators should be able to participate, on a \\npermanent or temporary basis, in joint oversight and investigation activities \\nconcerning matters covered by this Regulation. Those activities may include other \\ncompetent authorities and may cover a variety of issues, ranging from coordinated data \\ngathering exercises to requests for information or inspections of premises, within the \\nlimits and scope of powers available to each participating authority. The Board may be \\nrequested to provide advice in relation to those activities, for example by proposing \\nroadmaps and timelines for activities or proposing ad-hoc task-forces with \\nparticipation of the authorities involved.  \\n(87) \\nIn view of the particular challenges that may emerge in relation to assessing and \\nensuring a very large online platform\\u2019s compliance, for instance relating to the scale or \\ncomplexity of a suspected infringement or the need for particular expertise or \\ncapabilities at Union level, Digital Services Coordinators should have the possibility to \\nrequest, on a voluntary basis, the Commission to intervene and exercise its \\ninvestigatory and enforcement powers under this Regulation.  \\n(88) \\nIn order to ensure a consistent application of this Regulation, it is necessary to set up \\nan independent advisory group at Union level, which should support the Commission \\nand help coordinate the actions of Digital Services Coordinators. That European Board \\nfor Digital Services should consist of the Digital Services Coordinators, without \\nprejudice to the possibility for Digital Services Coordinators to invite in its meetings \\nor appoint ad hoc delegates from other competent authorities entrusted with specific \\ntasks under this Regulation, where that is required pursuant to their national allocation \\nof tasks and competences. In case of multiple participants from one Member State, the \\nvoting right should remain limited to one representative per Member State.  \\n(89) \\nThe Board should contribute to achieving a common Union perspective on the \\nconsistent application of this Regulation and to cooperation among competent \\nauthorities, including by advising the Commission and the Digital Services \\nCoordinators about appropriate investigation and enforcement measures, in particular \\nvis \\u00e0 vis very large online platforms. The Board should also contribute to the drafting \\nof relevant templates and codes of conduct and analyse emerging general trends in the \\ndevelopment of digital services in the Union. \\n EN \\n40 \\n EN \\n(90) \\nFor that purpose, the Board should be able to adopt opinions, requests and \\nrecommendations addressed to Digital Services Coordinators or other competent \\nnational authorities. While not legally binding, the decision to deviate therefrom \\nshould be properly explained and could be taken into account by the Commission in \\nassessing the compliance of the Member State concerned with this Regulation.  \\n(91) \\nThe Board should bring together the representatives of the Digital Services \\nCoordinators and possible other competent authorities under the chairmanship of the \\nCommission, with a view to ensuring an assessment of matters submitted to it in a \\nfully European dimension. In view of possible cross-cutting elements that may be of \\nrelevance for other regulatory frameworks at Union level, the Board should be allowed \\nto cooperate with other Union bodies, offices, agencies and advisory groups with \\nresponsibilities in fields such as equality, including equality between women and men, \\nand non-discrimination, data protection, electronic communications, audiovisual \\nservices, detection and investigation of frauds against the EU budget as regards \\ncustom duties, or consumer protection, as necessary for the performance of its tasks. \\n(92) \\nThe Commission, through the Chair, should participate in the Board without voting \\nrights. Through the Chair, the Commission should ensure that the agenda of the \\nmeetings is set in accordance with the requests of the members of the Board as laid \\ndown in the rules of procedure and in compliance with the duties of the Board laid \\ndown in this Regulation.  \\n(93) \\nIn view of the need to ensure support for the Board\\u2019s activities, the Board should be \\nable to rely on the expertise and human resources of the Commission and of the \\ncompetent national authorities. The specific operational arrangements for the internal \\nfunctioning of the Board should be further specified in the rules of procedure of the \\nBoard.  \\n(94) \\nGiven the importance of very large online platforms, in view of their reach and impact, \\ntheir failure to comply with the specific obligations applicable to them may affect a \\nsubstantial number of recipients of the services across different Member States and \\nmay cause large societal harms, while such failures may also be particularly complex \\nto identify and address.  \\n(95) \\nIn order to address those public policy concerns it is therefore necessary to provide for \\na common system of enhanced supervision and enforcement at Union level. Once an \\ninfringement of one of the provisions that solely apply to very large online platforms \\nhas been identified, for instance pursuant to individual or joint investigations, auditing \\nor complaints, the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment, upon its own \\ninitiative or upon the Board\\u2019s advice, should monitor any subsequent measure taken \\nby the very large online platform concerned as set out in its action plan. That Digital \\nServices Coordinator should be able to ask, where appropriate, for an additional, \\nspecific audit to be carried out, on a voluntary basis, to establish whether those \\nmeasures are sufficient to address the infringement. At the end of that procedure, it \\nshould inform the Board, the Commission and the platform concerned of its views on \\nwhether or not that platform addressed the infringement, specifying in particular the \\nrelevant conduct and its assessment of any measures taken. The Digital Services \\nCoordinator should perform its role under this common system in a timely manner and \\ntaking utmost account of any opinions and other advice of the Board.  \\n(96) \\nWhere the infringement of the provision that solely applies to very large online \\nplatforms is not effectively addressed by that platform pursuant to the action plan, only \\nthe Commission may, on its own initiative or upon advice of the Board, decide to \\n EN \\n41 \\n EN \\nfurther investigate the infringement concerned and the measures that the platform has \\nsubsequently taken, to the exclusion of the Digital Services Coordinator of \\nestablishment. After having conducted the necessary investigations, the Commission \\nshould be able to issue decisions finding an infringement and imposing sanctions in \\nrespect of very large online platforms where that is justified. It should also have such a \\npossibility to intervene in cross-border situations where the Digital Services \\nCoordinator of establishment did not take any measures despite the Commission\\u2019s \\nrequest, or in situations where the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment itself \\nrequested for the Commission to intervene, in respect of an infringement of any other \\nprovision of this Regulation committed by a very large online platform.  \\n(97) \\nThe Commission should remain free to decide whether or not it wishes to intervene in \\nany of the situations where it is empowered to do so under this Regulation. Once the \\nCommission initiated the proceedings, the Digital Services Coordinators of \\nestablishment concerned should be precluded from exercising their investigatory and \\nenforcement powers in respect of the relevant conduct of the very large online \\nplatform concerned, so as to avoid duplication, inconsistencies and risks from the \\nviewpoint of the principle of ne bis in idem. However, in the interest of effectiveness, \\nthose Digital Services Coordinators should not be precluded from exercising their \\npowers either to assist the Commission, at its request in the performance of its \\nsupervisory tasks, or in respect of other conduct, including conduct by the same very \\nlarge online platform that is suspected to constitute a new infringement. Those Digital \\nServices Coordinators, as well as the Board and other Digital Services Coordinators \\nwhere relevant, should provide the Commission with all necessary information and \\nassistance to allow it to perform its tasks effectively, whilst conversely the \\nCommission should keep them informed on the exercise of its powers as appropriate. \\nIn that regard, the Commission should, where appropriate, take account of any relevant \\nassessments carried out by the Board or by the Digital Services Coordinators \\nconcerned and of any relevant evidence and information gathered by them, without \\nprejudice to the Commission\\u2019s powers and responsibility to carry out additional \\ninvestigations as necessary.  \\n(98) \\nIn view of both the particular challenges that may arise in seeking to ensure \\ncompliance by very large online platforms and the importance of doing so effectively, \\nconsidering their size and impact and the harms that they may cause, the Commission \\nshould have strong investigative and enforcement powers to allow it to investigate, \\nenforce and monitor certain of the rules laid down in this Regulation, in full respect of \\nthe principle of proportionality and the rights and interests of the affected parties. \\n(99) \\nIn particular, the Commission should have access to any relevant documents, data and \\ninformation necessary to open and conduct investigations and to monitor the \\ncompliance with the relevant obligations laid down in this Regulation, irrespective of \\nwho possesses the documents, data or information in question, and regardless of their \\nform or format, their storage medium, or the precise place where they are stored. The \\nCommission should be able to directly require that the very large online platform \\nconcerned or relevant third parties, or than individuals, provide any relevant evidence, \\ndata and information. In addition, the Commission should be able to request any \\nrelevant information from any public authority, body or agency within the Member \\nState, or from any natural person or legal person for the purpose of this Regulation. \\nThe Commission should be empowered to require access to, and explanations relating \\nto, data-bases and algorithms of relevant persons, and to interview, with their consent, \\nany persons who may be in possession of useful information and to record the \\n EN \\n42 \\n EN \\nstatements made. The Commission should also be empowered to undertake such \\ninspections as are necessary to enforce the relevant provisions of this Regulation. \\nThose investigatory powers aim to complement the Commission\\u2019s possibility to ask \\nDigital Services Coordinators and other Member States\\u2019 authorities for assistance, for \\ninstance by providing information or in the exercise of those powers \\n(100) Compliance with the relevant obligations imposed under this Regulation should be \\nenforceable by means of fines and periodic penalty payments. To that end, appropriate \\nlevels of fines and periodic penalty payments should also be laid down for non-\\ncompliance with the obligations and breach of the procedural rules, subject to \\nappropriate limitation periods. \\n(101) The very large online platforms concerned and other persons subject to the exercise of \\nthe Commission\\u2019s powers whose interests may be affected by a decision should be \\ngiven the opportunity of submitting their observations beforehand, and the decisions \\ntaken should be widely publicised. While ensuring the rights of defence of the parties \\nconcerned, in particular, the right of access to the file, it is essential that confidential \\ninformation be protected. Furthermore, while respecting the confidentiality of the \\ninformation, the Commission should ensure that any information relied on for the \\npurpose of its decision is disclosed to an extent that allows the addressee of the \\ndecision to understand the facts and considerations that lead up to the decision.  \\n(102) In the interest of effectiveness and efficiency, in addition to the general evaluation of \\nthe Regulation, to be performed within five years of entry into force, after the initial \\nstart-up phase and on the basis of the first three years of application of this Regulation, \\nthe Commission should also perform an evaluation of the activities of the Board and \\non its structure.  \\n(103) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, \\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should \\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European \\nParliament and of the Council49. \\n(104) In order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in \\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to \\nsupplement this Regulation. In particular, delegated acts should be adopted in respect \\nof criteria for identification of very large online platforms and of technical \\nspecifications for access requests. It is of particular importance that the Commission \\ncarries out appropriate consultations and that those consultations be conducted in \\naccordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better \\nLaw-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the \\npreparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all \\ndocuments at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts \\nsystematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the \\npreparation of delegated acts. \\n(105) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights recognised by the Charter and the \\nfundamental rights constituting general principles of Union law. Accordingly, this \\nRegulation should be interpreted and applied in accordance with those fundamental \\n                                                 \\n49 Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying \\ndown the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the \\nCommission\\u2019s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13). \\n EN \\n43 \\n EN \\nrights, including the freedom of expression and information, as well as the freedom \\nand pluralism of the media. When exercising the powers set out in this Regulation, all \\npublic authorities involved should achieve, in situations where the relevant \\nfundamental rights conflict, a fair balance between the rights concerned, in accordance \\nwith the principle of proportionality. \\n(106) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the proper functioning of the internal \\nmarket and to ensure a safe, predictable and trusted online environment in which the \\nfundamental rights enshrined in the Charter are duly protected, cannot be sufficiently \\nachieved by the Member States because they cannot achieve the necessary \\nharmonisation and cooperation by acting alone, but can rather, by reason of its \\nterritorial and personal scope, be better achieved at the Union level, the Union may \\nadopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 \\nof the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, \\nas set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order \\nto achieve that objective, \\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: \\nChapter I \\u2013 General provisions \\nArticle 1 \\nSubject matter and scope \\n1. \\nThis Regulation lays down harmonised rules on the provision of intermediary \\nservices in the internal market.

By that moment, therefore, Member States shall have \\nappointed existing authorities and/or established new authorities performing the tasks \\nof the DSCs. At the same time, an ad hoc independent advisory group (the Board) \\nshould be set-up and effective in order to be able to plan its actions and start \\nreceiving and processing information from DSCs and the Commission, with a view \\nto provide its advises, opinion and recommendations in ensuring consistent \\napplication of the Regulation. Moreover, the Commission will be empowered to \\neventually perform direct supervision of certain platforms, in accordance with the \\nprocedures and criteria laid down in a delegated acts. By the same time, the \\nEuropean platform supporting the exchange of information should be fully operative. \\nIn the initial start-up phase and until the first short-term review of the Regulation, the \\nsupporting activities to the Board, as well as IT and internal applications \\ninfrastructure, should be provided by the Commission with the possible \\ncontribution/involvement of personnel from national DSCs as well.  \\n1.4.2. \\nAdded value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. \\ncoordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For \\nthe purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting \\n                                                 \\n53 \\nABM: activity-based management; ABB: activity-based budgeting. \\n54 \\nAs referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation. \\n EN \\n89 \\n EN \\nfrom Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been \\notherwise created by Member States alone. \\nReasons for action at European level (ex-ante): In order to ensure the proper \\nfunctioning of the single market, the intervention provides, inter alia, for the \\nappropriate supervision of digital services and cooperation between authorities at EU \\nlevel, therefore supporting trust, innovation and growth in the single market. This is \\nnecessary to ensure the best conditions for innovative cross-border digital services to \\ndevelop in the EU across national territories and at the same time maintain a safe \\nonline environment for all EU citizens, goals which can only be served at European \\nlevel. With specific regard to very large platforms, moreover, a strengthened \\nEuropean layer of supervision, coordinating and complementing national regulators, \\nis also necessary in view of the pan-EU reach and effects of regulation and \\nsupervision of these actors.  \\nExpected generated Union added value (ex-post): The Impact Assessment \\naccompanying this proposal identifies the sole added value of Union intervention \\naddressing the risk of legal fragmentation triggered by divergent regulatory and \\nsupervisory approaches (hence without accounting for the increased safety and trust \\non digital services) in a possible increase of cross-border digital trade of 1 to 1.8%, \\ni.e. the equivalent of an increase in turnover generated cross-border of EUR 8.6 \\nbillion and up to EUR 15.5 billion.  \\nWith regard to added value in the enforcement of measures, the initiative creates \\nimportant efficiency gains in the cooperation across Member States and mutualising \\nsome resources for technical assistance at EU level, for inspecting and auditing \\ncontent moderation systems, recommender systems and online advertising on very \\nlarge online platforms. This, in turn, leads to an increased effectiveness of \\nenforcement and supervision measures, whereas the current system relies to a large \\nextent on the limited capability for supervision in a small number of Member States. \\n EN \\n90 \\n EN \\n1.4.3. \\nLessons learned from similar experiences in the past \\nThe E-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC provides the core framework for the \\nfunctioning of the single market and the supervision of digital services and sets a \\nbasic structure for a general cooperation mechanism among Member States , \\ncovering in principle all requirements applicable to digital services. The evaluation \\nof the Directive pointed to shortcomings in several aspects of this cooperation \\nmechanism , including important procedural aspects such as the lack of clear \\ntimeframes for response from Member States coupled with a general lack of \\nresponsiveness to requests from their counterparts. This has led over the years to a \\nlack of trust between Member States in addressing concerns about providers offering \\ndigital services cross-border, in particular in what concerns online platforms. \\nMember States have instead regulated independently, in particular in imposing \\ndifferent rules covering obligations for online platforms and other online \\nintermediaries as regards illegal content, goods or services providers by their users. \\nThis legal fragmentation has serious repercussions both on the ability of European \\nservice providers to scale in the single market, and on the protection and safety \\nonline of EU citizens. The evaluation of the Directive and the impact assessment \\nshowed the need to define a differentiated set of rules and requirements at European \\nlevel, including specific obligations for very large platforms, which would require \\nappropriate and consistent supervisory tools and mechanisms at European level. For \\nthis reason the implementation of the specific obligations laid down in this \\nRegulation would require a specific cooperation mechanism at EU level, with a \\ngovernance structure ensuring coordinator of specific responsible bodies at EU level, \\nand a reinforced and agile EU level supervision of very large online platforms.  \\n1.4.4. \\nCompatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments  \\nThe Digital Services Act defines a new common framework of requirements \\napplicable to certain information society services (intermediaries), which goes well \\nbeyond the basic framework provided by the E-commerce Directive. For this reason, \\na new national and European regulatory and supervisory function needs to be \\nestablished with this proposal.   \\nAs regards possible synergies with the current cooperation model under the E-\\nCommerce Directive, this Regulation could trigger synergies in particular at national \\nlevel, where Digital Services Coordinator could also be entrusted with the task to \\nhandle the notifications pursuant to Article 3 of the E-commerce Directive, although \\nthe Regulation does not mandate it.  \\n EN \\n91 \\n EN \\n1.5. \\nDuration and financial impact  \\n\\uf0a8 limited duration  \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and \\nfrom YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.  \\n\\uf0fe unlimited duration \\n\\u2013 Implementation with a start-up period from 2023 to 2026, \\n\\u2013 followed by full-scale operation. \\n1.6. \\nManagement mode(s) planned55  \\n\\uf0fe Direct management by the Commission \\n\\u2013 \\uf0fe by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 by the executive agencies  \\n\\uf0a8 Shared management with the Member States  \\n\\uf0a8 Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to: \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated; \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified); \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund; \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation; \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 public law bodies; \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that \\nthey provide adequate financial guarantees; \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with \\nthe implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate \\nfinancial guarantees; \\n\\u2013 \\uf0a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP \\npursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act. \\n\\u2013 If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \\u2018Comments\\u2019 section. \\nComments  \\n \\n                                                 \\n55 \\nDetails of management modes and references to the Financial Regulation may be found on the \\nBudgWeb site: http://www.cc.cec/budg/man/budgmanag/budgmanag_en.html \\n EN \\n92 \\n EN \\n2. \\nMANAGEMENT MEASURES  \\n2.1. \\nMonitoring and reporting rules  \\nSpecify frequency and conditions. \\nThe Regulation will be reviewed and evaluated periodically. within five years from \\nthe entry into force of the regulation, and then every five years thereafter.

The \\nevaluation will, in particular, address the possible need to establish an autonomous \\nagency, and the financial implications of any such modification.

Commission will have to gradually redeploy internally the resources \\nneeded to ensure the fulfilment of its new tasks by the date of application of the Regulation, including the adoption of the \\nimplementing and delegated acts mandated by the Regulation.The Commission will have also to set a task force entrusted \\nwith the supervision on the application of the Regulation for very large platforms and the support to the Board\\u2019s activities.  \\nThe organigram will need to provide for 15 FTE (13 AD + 2 AST) to carry on the additional COM functions related to the DSA \\n(dispute settlement, direct supervision, implementing acts). \\nIn addition, a total work force of 35 FTE (14 AD/TA, 3 AST, 7 CA and 11 END) will need to be internally redeployed in the \\nCommission to provide the support to the Board, taking into account that it would require an active monitoring of approx \\n20/25 Very Large Platform (including screeing of all the regulatory documents) and involvement in the consistency/bilateral \\nmechanism (as a reference in IMI approx 10 notifications per year pursuant to Article 3 ECD were filed, and it is not excluded \\na similar, if not higher, amount of notifications could involve the new obligations of the DSA as regards all ISS operating in \\nEU). \\n \\nAs the initiative is of horizontal nature and cross-cuts various competence domains of the Commission, such as those related \\nto internal market, digital services, consumer protection, protection of fundamental freedoms on-line, the plan is to pull \\ntogether resources from all

An average \\ncost per consultation is estimated at 0.005mil EUR, accounting for targeted consultations and physical meetings, \\nand expecting that most consultations will be conducted online. Consultations focus on: risk assessment \\nframeworks (2 in 2024 and 2025 respectively, and one in 2026), draft guidelines (2 per annum in 2023 to 2025, \\nexpected to increase to 3 per annum thereafter), consultations preceding the adoption of implementing and \\ndelegated acts (3 in 2023 and 2 in 2024). \\n\\uf0b7 \\nA continuous communication support budget, supporting the stakeholder engagement around all the consultation \\nsteps, is foreseen with a 0.2 mil EUR per annum estimate, starting in 2024. \\n \\nOperational expenditure \\nStudies and consultations \\nThe Commission, in its support activities to the Board and for its own direct enforcement tasks, will need to be able to carry \\non in-depth analysis of algorithmic, data management and artificial intelligence systems underpinning the services of very \\nlarge platforms (approx 20/25 across EU). This will require recourse to very specialised expertise through ad hoc studies \\nand/or consultant supporting the analysis, and in particular: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nData access requests for risk assessment: expenditure related to data processing and external technical support, \\nwith an average estimate of 0.025mil EUR per request. Volumes of requests expected to increase and stabilise at \\naround 2 requests per year for each very large service provider supervised (for an expected number of 20 service \\nproviders) \\u2013 i.e. 40 such requests per annum starting in 2026, with 5 in 2023 and 20 in 2025 \\n\\uf0b7 \\nExpenditure for studies and data analyst experts will be necessary for establishing the methodological framework \\nand knowledge base necessary to identify risks and build-up the capabilities of public enforcer to protect European \\ncitizens and businesses from failures to comply with the Regulation, as well as standards and methodologies to \\nremedy them.  It is considered that studies will need to regularly ensure robust methodologies and frameworks for \\nauditing of a range of evolving algorithmic systems, risk assessment, as well as analysis of the most prominent \\nrisks, as resulting from overview of the sector (not strictly related to individual platforms/enforcement actions, but \\nalso involving systems with the capacity to shape specific markets and/or information dissemination across users in \\nthe Union). It is estimated a regime to perform up to 22 risk assessment, technical and feasibility studies with \\ncomplexity ranging from low (50k) to framework (1mil\\u20ac). Commitments for these studies are supposed to be paid \\noff upon completion of the studies, hence on average the financial year following signature of the contract \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWith regard to individual Technical inspections and regulatory audits over very large providers\\u2019 systems algorithmic \\nand artificial intelligence systems: expected to be high complexity (inspection of around 8 algorithmic systems) or \\n  \\nEN \\n10 \\n EN \\nmedium complexity (inspection of around 5 algorithmic systems). Cost estimates amount to 0.5 mil EUR for a high \\ncomplexity and 0.3mil EUR for a low complexity audit, with an average cost of 0.075 mil EUR for the inspection of \\none technical system (as estimated for external technical audits in SMART 2018/0037)  and additional resources \\nnecessary for the overall analysis. Costs cover the use of data scientists external contractors and procurement of \\nexternal support. It is expected that no such inspection will be conducted in 2023, but that the capacity and need \\nwill escalate to 16 (3 high complexity and 13 medium complexity) inspections in 2025. Inspections are supposed to \\nbe completed within a shorter period of time than studies and paid on average the same year of commitments.  \\nInformation and management systems (IT)  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nA core component supporting the application of the Regulation is a digital platform facilitating exchanges of \\ninformation between Member States, the Board and the Commission, as well as ensuring functionalities and \\ninteroperability with other functions provided for in the Regulation. Development costs are estimates at 4.5 mil EUR \\nover 4 years (2 mil in 2023 for its set-up, 1 mil in 2024 and 2025 for its full development and interoperability and \\n0.03 onwards to keep it up-to-date and interoperable. Maintenance and user assistance costs are also estimates at \\n0.001mil EUR in the first two years, and a more stable budget of 0.002mil EUR per annum thereafter. Payments for \\nfurther updates and developments are estimated on the financial year following the implementation/delivery of the \\nplatform. \\n \\nIn view of the above, the operational expenditure outside Heading 7 would be relevant for the following programmes of the \\nCommission \\n \\n- Digital Europe Programme: with regards to activities related to general studies and data analysis aiming at increasing \\ncapability of public enforcers in analysing, identifying and addressing risks related to systemic failures of Very Large \\nPlatforms within a common framework across the Union, as well as to perform data access requests and management and \\nbuild and set up the necessary IT information sharing platform that will allow the exchange of information among competent \\nauthorities

\\n02/06/2020 \\nLIKELY TYPE OF INITIATIVE \\nLegislative  \\nINDICATIVE PLANNING \\nQ4/2020 \\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \\n \\n \\nA. Context, Problem definition and Subsidiarity Check   \\nContext  \\nThere is wide consensus concerning the benefits for consumers and innovation, and a wide-range of efficiencies, \\nbrought about by online platforms in the European Union\\u2019s internal market. Online platforms facilitate cross-border \\ntrading within and outside the Union and open entirely new business opportunities to a variety of European \\nbusinesses and traders by facilitating their expansion and access to new markets. However, whereas over 10 000 \\nsuch online platforms operate in Europe\\u2019s digital economy, most of which are SMEs, a small number of large \\nonline platforms captures the biggest shares of the value. This mainly follows from the development of large \\nonline platforms operating as gatekeepers between businesses and citizens, benefitting from strong network \\neffects. Furthermore, some of these large online platforms exercise control over whole platform ecosystems that \\nare essentially impossible to contest by existing or new market operators, irrespective of how innovative and \\nefficient they may be.  \\nAgainst this background, the Platform-to-Business Regulation (EU) 2019/11501, which entered into force in June \\n2019 and will apply as of 12 July 2020, was conceived as a first step to establish a fair and transparent business \\nenvironment around online platforms (\\u2018online intermediation services\\u2019).  The Platform-to-Business Regulation has \\ncreated horizontal standards for transparency and offers redress for SMEs that may be using these platforms\\u2019 \\nservices.  \\nYet, beyond this, the current regulatory framework at EU level does not yet specifically address the economic \\npower that large online platforms acting as gatekeepers hold. Some Member States, such as Germany and \\nFrance have initiated legislative changes at national level, but following different approaches, pointing to a risk of \\nregulatory fragmentation and the need for action at the EU level to safeguard an effectively functioning digital \\nsingle market. \\nIn this light, the Communication on Shaping Europe`s Digital Future2 considered that, \\u2018based on the single market \\nlogic, additional rules may be needed to ensure contestability, fairness and innovation and the possibility of \\nmarket entry, as well as public interests that go beyond competition or economic considerations\\u2019. It announced \\nthat the Commission would further \\u2018explore, in the context of the Digital Services Act package, ex ante rules to \\nensure that markets characterised by large platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers, \\nremain fair and contestable for innovators, businesses, and new market entrants\\u2019.  \\nThis Inception Impact Assessment sets out the preliminary problem analysis and initial range of possible options \\nto regulate large online platforms benefiting from significant network effects and acting as gate-keepers, with the \\ngoal of ensuring that markets impacted by such platforms remain fair and contestable, as well as to provide \\nimproved regulatory oversight over the relevant platforms. \\nThe issues covered in this Inception Impact Assessment are complementary to related measures the Commission \\nis exploring. To ensure consistency and avoid possible overlaps, the impact assessment of the two following \\ninitiatives will be conducted in parallel: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nConcerning the responsibilities of online platforms on the safety of their users (e.g. business users; \\nconsumers) and their fundamental rights, a separate Inception Impact Assessment lists potential options, \\nwhich might follow in the package of measures under the Digital Services Act planned for end 2020 (Lead \\n                                                 \\n1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019R1150  \\n2 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/communication-shaping-europes-digital-future_en  \\nRef. Ares(2020)2877647 - 04/06/2020\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          2 \\nDG: DG CNECT). \\n\\uf0b7 \\nConcerning the announced3 evaluation and potential review of the fitness of EU competition rules for the \\ndigital age, a separate Inception Impact Assessment lists potential options on a new competition tool that \\nwould complement the existing EU competition law framework. The aim of such a tool would be to \\naddress certain structural competition problems that the existing competition framework cannot tackle \\n(e.g. monopolisation strategies by non-dominant companies with market power) or cannot address in the \\nmost effective manner (e.g. parallel leveraging strategies by dominant companies into multiple adjacent \\nmarkets). (Lead DG: DG COMP). To ensure consistency and avoid possible overlaps, notably in the \\nidentification of policy options to be pursued, the open public consultations and the impact assessment of \\nthe present initiative and the DG COMP-led initiative will be conducted in parallel. \\nProblem the initiative aims to tackle \\nLarge online platforms are able to control increasingly important platform ecosystems in the digital economy. \\nTypically, they feature an ability to connect many businesses with many consumers through their services that, in \\nturn, allows them to leverage their advantages, such as their access to large amounts of data4, from one area of \\ntheir activity to improve or develop new services in adjacent markets. These large online platforms also \\nincreasingly bundle a broad range of platform and other digital services into a seamless, data-driven offer. These \\nfeatures of the digital economy have also been prominently highlighted in several reports on the digital and \\nplatform economy in recent years. The source of the economic power of large online platforms does not stop \\nthere, since it also includes other factors such as ability to (i) accumulate large quantities of data, (ii) easily access \\ndifferent technical assets, (iii) easily expand into new markets and leverage their advantage from their services, \\n(iv) take over competitors or (v) benefit from their financial clout. Similar reflections on the need to regulate large \\nonline platforms benefiting from significant network effects and acting as gatekeepers are ongoing in major \\njurisdictions outside the EU such as Japan5, Australia6 and the US7. \\nThis leads to several consequences within the European Union\\u2019s internal market. While certain of the features \\ndescribed above may bring advantages to both business users and consumers, their unfettered application is \\nlikely to hamper the development of a fully functioning digital single market: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTraditional businesses are increasingly dependent on a limited number of large online platforms. This \\nleads to imbalances in the bargaining power between large online platforms on the one hand and their \\nusers and rivals on the other, a trend which is expected to increase in the future. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nMany innovative digital firms and start-ups find it difficult to bring innovative solutions, including innovative \\nalternatives to these large online platforms, to the consumer, in particular in view of the existence of an \\nincreasing number of \\u2018online platform ecosystems\\u2019 that these large online platforms operate. This raises a \\nrisk of reduced competition and dynamism and consequently reduced choice for consumers and business \\nusers in the long-run and their ability to take full advantage of the digital single market.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAn ability of a small number of large online platforms to comparatively easily enter adjacent markets, \\nsince they benefit from the use of data gathered from one area of their activity to improve or develop new \\nservices in these adjacent markets, increases a risk of these adjacent market also tipping in favour of \\nthese platforms to the detriment of innovation and consumer choice.  \\nA small number of large online platforms increasingly determines the parameters for future innovations, consumer \\nchoice and competition. Consequently, Europe\\u2019s estimated 10 000 online platforms are potentially hampered in \\nscaling broadly and thereby contributing to the EU\\u2019s technological sovereignty, as they are increasingly faced with \\nincontestable online platform ecosystems. This leads to a risk of reduced benefits from social gains deriving from \\ninnovation. These outcomes of platform dynamics may result in large-scale unfair trading practices and \\npotentially reduce the social gain from innovation. Their impact is compounded by the opacity and complexity \\nof the large online platform ecosystems, and the significant information advantage such platforms have over \\nregulators. \\nBeyond tackling the issues above, it is also important that the EU\\u2019s innovators can thrive and contribute to the \\neconomic recovery at the exit of the COVID-19 crisis. The measures by the public authorities to confine the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic weakened large parts of the EU economy and further increased the dependency of smaller \\nbusinesses relying on established online platform ecosystems to reach out to business users and consumers. A \\nfair trading and transparent business environment online will therefore be important in supporting European \\nbusinesses, heavily impacted by the confinement measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, to recover and \\nexpand their business online. \\n                                                 \\n3 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-europes-digital-future-feb2020_en_4.pdf  \\n4 For the purpose of the present Inception Impact Assessment the notion of data should be understood in a wide sense, which \\nmeans that it encompasses many different forms of data (e.g. image posted by user of a user of a social platform; users\\u2019 \\nsearch activity) and the variety of its uses (e.g. anonymized individual data; aggregated data).  \\n5 https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2019/October/191031.html.  \\n6 https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-platforms-inquiry-final-report.  \\n7 https://www.ftc.gov/policy/hearings-competition-consumer-protection.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          3 \\nSubsidiarity check (and legal basis)  \\nThe legal basis of this initiative is likely to be Article 114 TFEU, possibly to be complemented by other legal bases, \\ndepending on the exact type of measures to be proposed, following the impact assessment. \\nThe intrinsic and systemic cross-border nature of the services provided by the large online platforms implies that \\nno Member State alone can reach the objectives effectively. Large online platforms benefiting from significant \\neconomies of scale and acting as gatekeepers may be legally established in one Member State, but provide their \\nservices to almost the entire EU population.  \\nThe objectives of the initiative can be better reached at Union level to avoid a further fragmentation of the single \\nmarket into 27 different, potentially contradictory frameworks - including the resulting jurisdictional issues - and \\nprovide for more effective and coherent implementation and enforcement. Individual national solutions are likely to \\nlead to conflicting outcomes where they are applied by online platforms operating at a pan-European scale, \\nwhereas a multiplication of national rules in addition makes it disproportionately difficult for start-up platforms to \\nscale-up and compete.  \\nB. Objectives and Policy options \\nThe overarching policy objective of this initiative is to ensure a fair trading environment and increase the \\ninnovation potential and capacity across the online platform ecosystems in the EU\\u2019s single market.  \\nTo this end, the impact assessment will examine different policy options for the effective ex ante regulatory \\nframework that ensures that online platform ecosystems controlled by large online platforms that benefit from \\nsignificant network effects remain fair and contestable, in particular in situations where such platforms may act as \\ngatekeepers. The initiative would aim to establish clear obligations and prohibited practices for these large online \\nplatforms with economic power, application of which may provide European consumers and business users more \\nchoice and access to innovative solutions. This also includes an objective of making online platform ecosystems \\nand online activities more open, fair, predictable and accessible, increasing the social gain from innovation, and/or \\nlevelling the playing field between the platforms, on the one hand, as well as actual and/or potential competitors, \\non the other.  \\nWithin this context, the Commission would in the baseline scenario focus essentially on the application and \\nenforcement of the current regulatory instruments applicable to online platforms \\u2013 such as the Platform-to-\\nBusiness Regulation, competition law instruments and consumer and personal data protection rules. The \\nCommission would also continue to monitor the platform economy, including through the Observatory on the \\nOnline Platform Economy8. \\nAgainst this baseline scenario, the Commission will consider at least the following series of initial policy options:  \\n1. Revise the horizontal framework set in the Platform-to-Business Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 \\nBuilding, inter alia, on the insights from the Observatory for the Online Platform Economy and further evidence \\ncollection, and acting upon the review clause in Article 18(2) of the Platform-to-Business Regulation, further \\nhorizontal rules could be established for all online intermediation services that are currently falling within the scope \\nof the Platform-to-Business Regulation, through its revision. This could cover prescriptive rules on different \\nspecific practices that are currently addressed by transparency obligations in the Platform-to-Business Regulation \\nas well as on new, emerging practices (e.g. certain forms of \\u2018self-preferencing\\u2019, data access policies and unfair \\ncontractual provisions). A revised Platform-to-Business Regulation could also reinforce the existing oversight, \\nenforcement and transparency requirements. This revision would build on new or emerging issues identified in on-\\ngoing fact-findings, as well as on the information, to the extent already available, gathered from the transparency \\nprovisions introduced by the Platform-to-Business Regulation (e.g. on data access transparency; on the \\neffectiveness of the dispute resolution mechanisms). This revision of the Platform-to-Business Regulation would \\nnot seek to review the current provisions of the Platform-to-Business Regulation, but relate to certain targeted \\nhorizontally applicable additional provisions in view of the specific issues identified.   \\n2. Adopt a horizontal framework empowering regulators to collect information from large online \\nplatforms acting as gatekeepers \\nUnder this option further horizontal rules could be envisaged with a purpose to enable collection of information \\nfrom large online platforms acting as gatekeepers by a dedicated regulatory body at the EU level to gain, for \\nexample, further insights into their business practices and their impact on these platforms\\u2019 users and consumers. \\nThese rules would not only envisage further transparency (option 1), but would enable targeted collection of \\ninformation by a dedicated regulatory body at EU level. \\nWhile these horizontal rules would enable information gathering, they would not imply any power to impose \\nsubstantive behavioural and/or structural remedies on the large online platforms that would fall within the scope of \\nsuch rules. This would not exclude, however, enforcement powers in order to address the risk of refusal to provide \\n                                                 \\n8 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-observatory-online-platform-economy.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          4 \\nthe requested data by the large online platforms acting as gatekeepers.  \\n3. Adopt a new and flexible ex ante regulatory framework for large online platforms acting as \\ngatekeepers  \\nThis option would provide a new ex ante regulatory framework, which would apply to large online platforms that \\nbenefit from significant network effects and act as gatekeepers supervised and enforced through an enabled \\nregulatory function at EU level. The new framework would complement the horizontally applicable provisions of \\nthe Platform-to-Business Regulation (EU) 2019/1150, which would continue to apply to all online intermediation \\nservices. The more limited subset of large online platforms subject to the additional ex ante framework would be \\nidentified on the basis of a set of clear criteria, such as significant network effects, the size of the user base and/or \\nan ability to leverage data across markets. The relevance of using one or several of these criteria will be further \\nexplored in the impact assessment. Finally, this option would also explore possibilities for supervision and \\nenforcement at EU level.  \\nThis option would include two sub-options: \\n3a. Prohibition or restriction of certain unfair trading practices by large online platforms acting as \\ngatekeepers (\\u201cblacklisted\\u201d practices) \\nAn ex ante regulatory tool applicable to large online platforms with a gatekeeping role would establish clear \\nobligations that these platforms would be required to comply with and establish prohibited or restricted unfair \\ntrading practices (\\u201cblacklisted\\u201d practices). Such a set of clearly defined and predetermined obligations and \\nprohibited practices would aim at ensuring open and fair trading online, especially when these practices are \\npotentially market-distorting or entrenching economic power of the large online platforms (e.g. certain forms of \\nself-preferencing; acceptance of supplementary commercial conditions that by their nature have no connection \\nwith the underlying contractual relationship).  \\nThis option will explore both principles-based prohibitions that apply regardless of the sector in which the online \\nplatforms concerned intermediate (e.g. a horizontal prohibition of intra-platform \\u2018self-preferencing\\u2019), as well as \\nmore issue-specific substantive rules on emerging problems associated only with certain actors, e.g. relating to \\noperating systems, algorithmic transparency, or issues relating to online advertising services. \\n3b. Adoption of tailor-made remedies addressed to large online platforms acting as gatekeepers on a \\ncase-by-case basis where necessary and justified \\nBesides establishing obligations and prohibiting certain unfair trading practices (\\u201cblacklisted\\u201d practices) as \\nenvisaged under sub-option 3a, a new ex ante regulatory framework would also include an ability to impose, \\nwhere considered necessary and justified following a prior assessment, tailor-made remedies envisaged by such \\nframework covering the specific issue(s) and individual large online platform companies at stake, and applied on a \\nflexible, case-by-case basis. Examples of such remedies that would be adopted and enforced by a competent \\nregulatory body (in principle acting at the EU level) could include platform-specific non-personal data access \\nobligations, specific requirements regarding personal data portability, or interoperability requirements. While \\nrecognising the many differences, experience from the targeted and tailor-made ex ante regulation of \\ntelecommunications services can serve as an inspiration in this regard, given the similarities deriving from network \\ncontrol and network effects. This second pillar of an ex ante regulatory framework for large online platforms acting \\nas gatekeepers would address the diversity and fast evolution of specific phenomena in the online platform \\neconomy.   \\nThe different policy options are not mutually exclusive and the impact assessment could assess them as both \\nalternatives and/or complements.  \\nThe Commission will ensure a joint analysis of the results of the impact assessment led by DG COMP and \\nreferred to above under the \\u201cContext\\u201d section with a view to exploring synergies and ensuring consistency on the \\npolicy options pursued, in particular as regards possible remedies and enforcement. \\n  \\nLikely economic impacts \\nThe initiative would have positive impact on businesses (including SMEs) as, by providing for legal certainty, less \\nregulatory fragmentation and increased level playing field, will allow these innovative SMEs to grow and develop \\ntheir own products or services and innovate. Consumers and business users would continue to benefit from a \\nlarge choice of products and services in a digital environment, while increased competition brought by alternative \\nonline platforms would lead to better innovation outcomes. Consequently, this would lead to an increase in overall \\nconsumer welfare, as well as an increase in the fairness and competitiveness of the EU economy.The initiative \\nwill look at the overall effects that such regulation of large online platforms benefiting from strong network effects \\nand acting as gatekeepers may have on consumers.       \\nBy setting the right fair trading conditions and thereby facilitating an equality of innovation opportunities, especially \\naround cutting-edge technologies, it is expected that the existing and/or emerging online platform services will be \\nsubject to increased competition and contestability. This would have a positive impact on innovation and research, \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          5 \\ntechnological development and growth of the digital economy.   \\nThe initiative is expected to limit the negative effects of strong network effects accompanied by significant \\nimbalances in commercial relationships identified in the digital economy. If not addressed, issues related to the \\neconomic power of large online platforms benefiting from strong network effects and acting as gatekeepers would \\ncontinue strengthening platforms\\u2019 already strong gatekeeper position and risks keeping innovative market \\noperators from expanding or entering the market in the first place.  \\nThe possible (positive) impact of the initiative on innovation and entrepreneurship is particularly relevant in this \\nregard. EU action in this field could contribute to the creation of level playing field for platforms of all sizes. \\nLikely social impacts  \\nBy ensuring the contestability of the online platforms ecosystem, the proposal would safeguard long-term \\nconsumer and business users\\u2019 interests and consumer welfare.  \\nLikely environmental impacts \\nThe possible impact of the policy options on the environment will be assessed in the Impact Assessment. Given \\nthe variety of sectors where online platforms are active (e.g. tourism activities, sales of goods, transport), the \\nenvironmental implications are also likely to be very diverse.  \\nLikely impacts on fundamental rights \\nThe impact assessment for any initiative addressing the market power of large online platforms with gatekeeping \\nrole would need to closely assess possible impacts on the fundamental right to freely conduct a business, as \\nprotected by Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the 'Charter'). The option \\nretained should not go beyond what is necessary and proportionate to restore the effective functioning of the \\nmarkets in question, to achieve an optimal balance between the possibly conflicting rights to freely conduct a \\nbusiness enjoyed by large online platforms with gatekeeping role on the one hand, and their users on the other. \\nFurthermore, the impact assessment for any initiative on economic power of large online platforms with \\ngatekeeping role should also duly take into account the impact on the right to protection of personal data (Article 8 \\nof the Charter) and the right to privacy (Article 7 of the Charter). Finally, the options will also have to take into \\naccount the rights of defence and the right to judicial review of the companies subject to individual measures. \\nLikely impacts on simplification and/or administrative burden \\nThe impact assessment will have due regard for the comparative impact/benefit of the various policy options \\noutlined above, in terms of administrative burden for companies and cost of oversight for regulatory authorities.  \\nD. Data Collection and Better Regulation Instruments  \\nImpact assessment \\nAn impact assessment is being prepared to support the preparation of this initiative and to inform the \\nCommission's decision. \\nData collection  \\nThis initiative builds on evidence gathered through more than four years of analysis conducted within the \\nEuropean Commission on the economic environment of online platforms. The 2016 public consultation on \\nplatforms, the evidence-base underpinning the Platform-to-Business Regulation as well as first experiences with \\nthe implementation of the latter Regulation all contribute to the analysis underpinning the present initiative. The \\nCommission will moreover ensure that it takes into account all relevant external data that is available, including \\ndozens of recent reports on platform power by regulators as well as by academic experts.  \\nIn addition, the Commission is procuring a dedicated, independent study supporting the Impact Assessment. The \\nCommission\\u2019s Joint Research Centre will in parallel conduct economic analyses of the various policy options \\nexplored in this Impact Assessment under its continuous cooperation with the Commission on the topic of online \\nplatforms. \\nFinally, the Observatory on the Online Platform Economy has for the past year been analysing the existing \\nresearch on the topic, and is continuing to carry out its own research in this field with the help of an external study \\nsupporting the work of the Observatory.  \\nConsultation strategy \\nThe Commission intends to launch an online public consultation on a broad range of online platforms related \\nissues, including the economic power of large online platforms, with gatekeeping role. The objective of the public \\nconsultation is to gather stakeholder\\u2019s views on existing and emerging issues concerning the economic power of  \\nlarge online platform, with gatekeeping role, gather evidence and data underpinning the problems identified and \\ncollected informed view of the possible policy options and their impact. \\nIn addition, the publication of the Observatory expert group interim reports on data practices, differentiated \\ntreatment and measurement of online platform economy is envisaged for the second quarter of 2020, which \\nshould be followed by a peer review and commenting period.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          6 \\nAt the same time, a structured dialogue with Member States is on-going, notably through the e-Commerce expert \\ngroup (established by Commission Decision 2005/752/EC).  \\nWill an Implementation plan be established? \\nPending further analysis of the options and their complexity in the impact assessment, an implementation plan \\ncould be developed. \\n \\n\",\n          \" \\n \\n \\nCOMBINED EVALUATION ROADMAP/INCEPTION  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT  \\nThis combined evaluation roadmap/Inception Impact Assessment aims to inform citizens and stakeholders about the \\nCommission's work in order to allow them to provide feedback on the intended initiative and to participate effectively in future \\nconsultation activities. Citizens and stakeholders are, in particular, invited to provide views on the Commission's understanding \\nof the current situation, problem and possible solutions and to make available any relevant information that they may have, \\nincluding on possible impacts of the different options. \\nTITLE OF THE INITIATIVE \\nDigital Services Act package: deepening the Internal Market and clarifying \\nresponsibilities for digital services  \\nLEAD DG \\u2013 RESPONSIBLE UNIT \\n\\u2013 AP NUMBER \\nCONNECT F.2 \\nLIKELY TYPE OF INITIATIVE \\nLegislative instrument \\nINDICATIVE PLANNING \\nQ4 2020 \\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \\n- \\nThis combined roadmap/Inception Impact Assessment is provided for information purposes only. It does not \\nprejudge the final decision of the Commission on whether this initiative will be pursued or on its final content. All \\nelements of the initiative described by this document, including its timing, are subject to change. \\nA. Context, Evaluation, Problem definition and Subsidiarity Check   \\nContext   \\nThe Commission announced1 that it intends to propose new and revised rules to deepen the Internal Market for \\nDigital Services, by increasing and harmonising the responsibilities and obligations of digital services and, in \\nparticular, online platforms and reinforce the oversight and supervision of digital services in the EU.  \\n2\\ne-Commerce Directive \\nThe horizontal legal framework for digital services  is unchanged since the adoption of the \\nin 2000. The Directive harmonised the basic principles allowing the cross-border provision of services and has \\nbeen a foundational cornerstone for regulating digital services in the EU. In addition, several measures taken at \\nEU level address, through both legislative instruments3 and non-binding ones4 and voluntary5 cooperation, \\ntargeted issues related to specific illegal or harmful activities conducted online by users\\u2019 of digital services and \\nonline platforms in particular. \\nTechnologies, business models and societal challenges are evolving constantly. The wider spectrum of digital \\nservices is the backbone of an increasingly digitised world. This spectrum incorporates a wider range of services, \\nincluding cloud infrastructure or content distribution networks. Online platforms like search engines, market \\nplaces, social networks, or media-sharing platforms intermediate a wide spectrum of activities and play a \\nparticularly important role in how citizens communicate, share and consume information, and how businesses \\n                                                 \\n1  Digital Strategy \\u201cShaping Europe\\u2019s Digital Future\\u201d of 19 February, 2020 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-\\neuropes-digital-future-feb2020_en_4.pdf  \\n2  The term \\u2018digital service\\u2019 is used interchangeably here with \\u2018information society service\\u2019, defined as \\u2018any service normally provided for \\nremuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services\\u2019 (Directive (EU) 2015/1535) \\n3  Legislation addressing specific types of illegal goods and illegal content includes: the Market Surveillance Regulation, the revised audio-visual \\nmedia services directive, the directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, the directive on copyright in the digital single market, \\nthe regulation on market surveillance and compliance of products, the proposed regulation on preventing the dissemination of terrorist content \\nonline, the directive on combatting the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the regulation on the marketing \\nand use of explosives precursors etc. The Directive on better enforcement and modernisation of EU consumer protection rules added \\ntransparency requirements for online marketplaces vis-\\u00e0-vis consumers which should become applicable in May 2022. \\n4  The Commission has also set general guidelines to online platforms and Member States for tackling illegal content online through a \\nCommunication (2017) and a Recommendation (2018) \\n5  e.g. the EU Internet Forum against terrorist propaganda online, the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, the Alliance to \\nbetter protect minors online under the European Strategy for a better internet for children and the WePROTECT global alliance to end child \\nsexual exploitation online, the Joint Action of the consumer protection cooperation network authorities, Memorandum of understanding against \\ncounterfeit goods, the Online Advertising and IPR Memorandum of Understanding, the Safety Pledge to improve the safety of products sold \\nonline etc. In the framework of the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation (CPC), the consumer protection authorities have also taken \\nseveral coordinated actions to ensure that various platforms (e.g travel booking operators, social media, online gaming platforms, web shops)  \\nconform with consumer protection law in the EU. A package of measures was also adopted to secure free and fair elections - \\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_18_5681 \\n \\nRef. Ares(2020)2877686 - 04/06/2020\\n  \\n2 \\ntrade online, and which products and services are offered to consumers. Online advertising and recommender \\nsystems are a core feature of most online platforms. \\nThis digital transformation has brought major benefits but also challenges. For example, the online sale of \\ncounterfeit, dangerous products or other illegal goods puts citizens at risk and harms legitimate businesses. \\nDigital services are exploited by certain users to spread illegal content online such as child sexual abuse material \\nor illegal hate speech. Infringements to property rights are also observed. Other risks are related to the systematic \\nabuse of digital services and their algorithmic processes for amplifying the propagation of disinformation online. \\nThe safety of vulnerable users, and in particular children, is also a challenge. The outbreak of the COVID-19 \\npandemic has clearly confirmed both the importance of digital services and their vulnerabilities. Further concerns \\nrelate to the social impact in the use of online platforms, and the opportunities and challenges they bring for \\nworkers and individuals offering services through platforms. \\nTo address these issues effectively and to avoid the emergence of an increasingly fragmented legal landscape in \\nthe internal market, the Commission has committed to update the horizontal rules that define the responsibilities \\nand obligations of digital services. Against this context, the high-level goals of the Commission\\u2019s intended \\nproposal for a new Digital Services Act are to reinforce the internal market for digital services, to lay down clearer, \\nmore stringent, harmonised rules for their responsibilities in order to increase citizen\\u2019s safety online and protect \\ntheir fundamental rights, whilst strengthening the effective functioning of the internal market to promote innovation, \\ngrowth and competitiveness, particularly of European digital innovators, scale-ups, SMEs and new entrants. This \\nInception Impact Assessment sets out this intervention logic. \\nThe issues covered in this Inception Impact Assessment are closely connected to additional measures the \\nCommission is exploring:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nA separate Inception Impact Assessment is exploring potential options for an ex-ante regulatory \\ninstrument for very large online platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers in the \\nEU\\u2019s internal market, which was announced as part of the Digital Services Act package planned for end \\n20206 \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIn the context of the announced evaluation and potential review of the fitness of EU competition rules for \\nthe digital age, a separate Inception Impact Assessment lists potential options for a new competition tool \\nthat would complement the existing EU competition law framework, potentially applicable to all economic \\nsectors (including individual platform ecosystems or digital markets). \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe Commission is also currently carrying out a REFIT of the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD). \\nThe fact-finding and consultation activities for the two instruments will be closely associated to ensure \\ncoherence of the legal framework.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe Commission will also \\u2018look at ways of improving the labour conditions of platform workers\\u20197 by \\nlaunching a broader debate on working conditions in the context of the platform economy and consulting \\non a series of issues already in the open public consultation launched for the purpose of the Digital \\nServices Act. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe Commission is reviewing the Code of Practice on Disinformation to address the spread of \\ndisinformation and working towards a European Democracy Action Plan, to find ways to reduce the \\npossibility of manipulation in the public space. \\nEvaluation \\ne-\\nAhead of the Impact Assessment for the Digital Services Act, the Commission will conduct an evaluation of the \\nCommerce Directive, in line with the \\u2019evaluate first\\u2019 principle of the Better Regulation guidelines.  \\nThis Directive covers all information society services ranging from the very \\u2018backbone\\u2019 of the Internet (e.g. internet \\nservice providers) to online intermediaries such as web hosts, cloud services and online platforms.  \\nIts main objectives are: \\n  \\n1. Strengthen the single market and establish the framework conditions for digital innovations to emerge and \\nfor swift and effective enforcement: this rests on the principles of home state control, a mechanism for \\ncooperation between Member States on cross-border issues, and the guarantee of the freedom of \\n                                                 \\n6  Commission \\u2019s Communication of 19 February 2020 on Shaping Europe\\u2019s Digital Future https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-\\n2024/europe-fit-digital-age/shaping-europe-digital-future_en  \\n7  Platform work can be described as an activity that uses an online platform to enable organisations or individuals to access other organisations \\nor individuals to solve problems or to provide services in exchange for payment.  \\n  \\n3 \\nestablishment and of the freedom to provide digital services cross-border in the Union.  \\n2. For the subcategory of services that intermediate third party content (e.g. internet service providers, cloud \\nservices, web hosts, or online platforms), special provisions are aimed at allowing them to function \\neffectively in the internal market, by harmonising the exemption from liability for illegal content across the \\nsingle market. The underlying objective was to allow digital innovation, while also protecting users \\nfreedom of expression. \\n3. Enhance trust in digital services, including by providing a high level of consumer protection and \\ntransparency of digital services.  \\n \\nIt is clear that these objectives remain valid. The core principles of the Directive have been the corner stone of the \\ninternal market for digital services. Whilst they may need certain adjustments, the underpinning basis is as valid \\ntoday as it has been 20 years ago. The evaluation will be informed by a process of evidence-collection, not least \\nrelated to the legal and economic barriers emerging in the internal market for digital services. The effectiveness, \\nefficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value of the measures in place will be evaluated, including in light \\nRecommendation of 2018, on measures to effectively tackle illegal content \\nof more recent measures, such as the \\nonline, as well as changes in the nature and diversity of digital services and risks they entail, notably with the \\nincreased use of services provided from outside the Union, which are not covered today by the E-Commerce \\nDirective. It will cover the entire period, from the entry into force of the Directive until the present, and use a \\n2003\\ncomparative methodology, building on previously published implementation reports (\\n \\n2012\\nand \\n), and on more \\nrecent and ongoing studies. The evidence collection will focus in particular on the past 10 years, most prominently \\nmarked by a rapid evolution of information society services, new forms of online behaviours and case law.  \\nProblem the initiative aims to tackle \\nThe rapid and widespread development of digital services has been at the heart of the digital transformation, \\nincluding the rise of e-commerce and unprecedented opportunities for information to be freely shared online. \\nWhile there is a broad consensus on the benefits of this transformation, the scale of problems arising from \\ndigital services is substantially different from 20 years ago. In particular, the impact of online sales of \\ncounterfeit, dangerous or unauthorised products or other illegally traded goods (including those imported from \\ntraders based outside of the EU) is increasing, and so is the online dissemination of illegal content such as hate \\nspeech or child sexual abuse material.  \\nAn entirely new set of issues has also emerged with the scale of information intermediated online: \\nrecommender systems and online advertising play an important part in optimising consumers\\u2019 access to \\ninformation. At the same time, services are also abused to disseminate harmful content such as online \\ndisinformation (which is not, per se, illegal), exploiting algorithmic systems to amplify the spread of the messages.  \\nThese new challenges have an important bearing on fundamental rights online, and the appropriate division of \\n.\\nresponsibilities between the relevant stakeholders, including private and public actors. .  \\nThe relative scale and impact of these issues is particularly important where the most prominent online \\nplatforms structure at scale information flows online, having become de facto \\u2018public spaces\\u2019 in the online \\nworld. \\nWhile a range of targeted, sector-specific interventions have been taken at EU level, significant gaps and legal \\nburdens remain unaddressed.  \\nThe Impact Assessment will analyse in detail a series of problems:  \\n1. Fragmentation in the Single Market and need for reinforced cross-border cooperation \\nIn response to the increasing role of digital services in the online trade in or dissemination of illegal goods and \\ncontent, Member States are increasingly passing laws with notable differences in the obligations imposed on \\ndigital services, in particular online platforms, and with a variety of different enforcement mechanisms. This \\ncreates a fragmentation of the single market that can negatively affect EU citizens and businesses in the absence \\nof harmonised rules and obligations. It also entails a lack of legal clarity and certainty for digital services in the \\ninternal market, and is likely to be less effective in achieving the underlying public policy objectives.  \\nExisting cross-border cooperation mechanisms appear insufficient for addressing local problems posed by the use \\nof online platforms. Stronger, more systematic and agile cooperation between authorities on the basis of common \\nrules for addressing illegal goods and content would strengthen their mutual trust and the effective enforcement. \\nOptions for addressing harmful, but not necessarily illegal content, would also be in scope, while respecting the \\nimportant distinction between the two. This would help better protect users, improve the functioning of the single \\nmarket, especially if combined with a capacity to gather all relevant information from platforms. Experience from \\nexisting cooperation structures (such as BEREC, CPC Network, RAPEX) will be taken into consideration, as well \\nas the new competences introduced under the AVMSD for audiovisual regulatory authorities and their cooperation \\nmechanism under the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services (ERGA).The underlying \\n  \\n4 \\nregulatory and market evolutions pose risks to the competitiveness of the internal market, by restricting the \\nfreedom of establishment of digital businesses and their freedom to provide cross-border services. Facing \\npotentially 27 different regimes across the EU, an innovative digital service would struggle to benefit from the \\nSingle Market to grow and scale up: only the largest platforms can absorb the costs of diverging rules and \\nprocedures. This is also ineffective in protecting Europeans in a consistent and comprehensive manner across the \\nsingle market.  \\n2. Risks for the safety of citizens online and the protection of their fundamental rights \\nOnline platforms continue to play a significant role in the spread illegal goods, illegal services and content online. \\nIn the absence of clearly defined responsibilities at EU level for digital services in general, and platforms in \\nparticular, the level of protection for citizens\\u2019 safety online is not consistent across all services. When platforms do \\ntake steps to address illegal behaviour, they can face uncertainty under the existing legal framework (notably for \\nvoluntary measures to detect illegal content).  \\nAt the same time, protections of users\\u2019 rights \\u2013 including the freedom to receive or impart information \\u2013 are not \\nalways sufficiently robust across the board.  \\nIn many instances, there is also a lack of accountability in the private decisions taken by online platforms, and the \\ncurrent legal framework does not allow any scrutiny of how platforms shaping information flows online, including \\nthe role played by associated online advertising services. Further strengthening of the cooperation between \\nservice providers and authorities is also needed to ensure public policy objectives on safety and security.  \\nIn addition, while the e-Commerce Directive does not currently apply to services established in third countries, \\nservices without legal establishment in the EU are increasingly gaining importance in the EU, be it in the field of e-\\nCommerce or in social media services. Today, these remain effectively unregulated. \\n \\n3.\\nSignificant information asymmetries and ineffective oversight across the single market  \\nThere is currently a lack of oversight over digital services in the current legal framework, with significant \\ninformation asymmetries between the services and their users (citizens and businesses), as well as with regards \\nto public authorities. Transparency reports published by online platforms on measures taken to counter the spread \\nof illegal goods or content are generally voluntary, partial, and difficult to compare across services. In addition, \\nwhen services take measures against \\u201charmful\\u201d content, which is not per se illegal, such measures, as well as \\ntheir impacts \\u2013 on reducing individual and social harms, but also on freedom of expression -, are difficult to \\nscrutinise. There is also no structured, legally binding cooperation or dialogue for emerging issues, such as \\nunforeseen issues relating to \\u201charmful\\u201d content, or unexpected forms of manipulation of platforms\\u2019 services. This \\naccountability gap also concerns algorithmic processes used by online platforms \\u2013 e.g. recommender systems, \\ncontent moderation tools, or ad placements. \\nBasis for EU intervention (legal basis and subsidiarity check)  \\nThe intervention addresses the freedoms of establishment and to provide services and the proper functioning of \\nthe Single Market for digital services. As such, the legal basis considered likely would be Article 114 of the Treaty \\nof the Functioning of the European Union and, potentially, Articles 49 and 56.  \\nGiven the fundamentally cross-border nature of many digital services and of the risks and opportunities they bring, \\nthe intervention is best taken at EU level. The objectives cannot be effectively reached by any Member State \\nacting alone. \\nB. Objectives and Policy options       \\nThe general objective is to provide for a modern legal framework for digital services, strengthening the Digital \\nSingle Market and ensuring that digital service providers present in the Union act responsibly to mitigate risks \\nemanating from the use of their service, respecting Union rights and values, and protecting fundamental rights. \\nThis initiative aims at establishing a balanced and effective governance online and at clarifying roles, procedures \\nand responsibilities. \\nIn the baseline scenario, the Commission would make no changes to the current legal framework, in particular to \\nRecommendation on \\nthe E-Commerce Directive. The Commission would monitor the take-up of the Commission\\u2019s \\nmeasures to effectively tackle illegal content online, and the transposition of the Directive on Copyright in the \\nDigital Single Market, the recently amended Audiovisual Media Services Directive and the Terrorist Content \\nRegulation, once adopted.. Further action would focus in particular on more self-regulatory actions, which are \\nnaturally limited to some services participating on a voluntary basis, and with limitations regarding the \\nenforcement or monitoring of the results. Courts would continue to interpret the obligations of new digital services \\nagainst the framework of existing EU law, in particular the provisions for hosting services in Article 14 of the E-\\n  \\n5 \\nCommerce Directive. \\nIn the absence of further EU legislation, legal fragmentation is likely to increase. A patchwork of national \\nmeasures would not effectively protect citizens, given the cross-border and international dimension of the issues. \\nThe proliferation of illicit goods sold online and the dissemination of illegal content would likely continue, and no \\nharmonised safeguards against over-removal of legal content would exist. Barriers for promising European \\ncompanies to scale up in the internal market would increase, reinforcing the stronghold of large online platforms, \\nand reducing the competitiveness of the internal market.  \\nOther policy options will be impact-assessed following the general lines presented below. The approach \\npresented in option 3 is complementary to the others. \\n1. A limited legal instrument would regulate online platforms\\u2019 procedural obligations, essentially \\nmaking the horizontal provisions of the 2018 Recommendation binding.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThis would build on the scope of the e-Commerce Directive, focusing on services established in \\nthe EU.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt would lay out the responsibilities of online platforms with regard to sales of illegal products and \\nservices and dissemination of illegal content and other illegal activities of their users. They would \\ninclude proportionate obligations such as effective notice-and-action mechanisms to report illegal \\ncontent or goods, as well as effective redress obligations such as counter notice procedures and \\ntransparency obligations.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThis option would neither clarify nor update the liability rules of the e-Commerce Directive for \\nplatforms or other online intermediaries \\n2. A more comprehensive legal intervention, updating and modernising the rules of the e-Commerce \\nDirective, while preserving its main principles.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt would clarify and upgrade the liability and safety rules for digital services and remove \\ndisincentives for their voluntary actions to address illegal content, goods or services they \\nintermediate, in particular in what concerns online platform services. Definitions of what is illegal \\nonline would be based on other legal acts at EU and national level.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt would harmonise a set of specific, binding and proportionate obligations, specifying the different \\nresponsibilities in particular for online platform services.8 In addition to a basic set of generally \\napplicable obligations, further asymmetric obligations may be needed depending on the type, \\nsize, and/or risk a digital service presents, as well as a cooperation framework and due process \\nrequirements for crisis situations.  \\nObligations could include: \\no \\nharmonised obligations to maintain \\u2018notice-and-action\\u2019 systems covering all types of \\nillegal goods, content, and services, as well as \\u2018know your customer\\u2019 schemes for \\ncommercial users of marketplaces  \\no \\nrules ensuring effective cooperation of digital service providers with the relevant \\nauthorities and \\u2018trusted flaggers\\u2019 (e.g. the INHOPE hotlines for a swifter removal of child \\nsexual abuse material) and reporting, as appropriate  \\no \\nrisk assessments could be required from online platforms for issues related to exploitation \\nof their services to disseminate some categories of harmful, but not illegal, content, such \\nas disinformation  \\no \\nmore effective redress and protection against unjustified removal for legitimate content \\nand goods online  \\no \\na set of transparency and reporting obligations related to the these processes \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt would also explore transparency, reporting and independent audit obligations to ensure \\naccountability with regards to algorithmic systems for (automated) content moderation and \\nrecommender systems, as well as online advertising and commercial communications, including \\npolitical advertising and micro-targeting aspects, beyond personal data protection rights and \\nobligations. Such measures would enable effective oversight of online platforms and would \\nsupport the efforts to tackle online disinformation. Issues related to legal clarity around smart \\n                                                 \\n8  This would be coherent with the rules agreed in the AVMSD, which introduce some obligations for video-sharing platforms, including against \\nhate speech, and with the 2018 Recommendation. \\n  \\n6 \\ncontracts would also be considered. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt would explore extending coverage of such measures to all services directed towards the \\nEuropean single market, including when established outside the Union, with a view to identifying \\nthe most effective means of enforcement.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe instrument would also establish dissuasive and proportionate sanctions for systematic failure \\nto comply with the harmonised responsibilities or the respect of fundamental rights. \\n3. Options for creating an effective system of regulatory oversight, enforcement and cooperation \\nacross Member States, supported at EU level. These options, in complement to the previous options, \\nwould aim to reinforce the updated set of rules (as per Option 1 or 2 above). They should provide for an \\neffective EU-wide governance of digital services through a sufficient level of harmonisation of rules and \\nprocedures. Based on the country-of-origin principle, these options would allow Member States\\u2019 \\nauthorities to deal with illegal content, goods or services online, including swift and effective cooperation \\nprocedures for cross-border issues in the regulation and oversight over digital services. Public authorities\\u2019 \\ncapabilities for supervising digital services would be strengthened including through appropriate powers \\nfor effective and dissuasive sanctions for systemic failure of services established in their jurisdiction to \\ncomply with the relevant obligations, potentially supported at EU level. Options for effective judicial \\nredress would also be explored.  \\nFor all the options, coherence with sector-specific regulation \\u2013 e.g. the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single \\nMarket, the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the proposal for a Regulation on Terrorist Content \\nOnline \\u2013 as well as the EU\\u2019s international obligations will be ensured. The intervention would not seek to modify \\nrules established under these recently adopted or proposed acts, but complement these rules by renewing the \\nhorizontal rules for digital services.   \\nC.  Preliminary Assessment of Expected Impacts  \\nThe impact assessment will assess, for each option, the following types of likely impacts: \\nLikely economic impacts \\nThe expected economic impacts are mainly related to benefits deriving from the removal of legal barriers in the \\ninternal market for digital services, and greater legal certainty, to be assessed against the cost of harmonised \\nrules for such services across the EU. Particular attention will be paid to the impacts on innovative European \\nSMEs, and their ability to scale up across borders in the internal market of the EU. The competitiveness of digital \\nservices in the single market will be a decisive factor in ensuring a swift economic recovery following the COVID-\\n19 crisis. A strong digital services sector will to a large extent drive growth and enable a series of subsequent \\nservices, including the sale of goods to thrive. There would also be positive indirect impacts for businesses \\nengaged in legitimate trade in goods and services, including quality media. \\nThe impacts on service providers from third countries would also be assessed, given that those would be in scope \\nof Option 2.  \\nThe assessment of economic impacts would consider the size of the targeted service providers, the capacity of \\nthe provider, and, will be assessed against costs for mechanisms already implemented today.  \\nLikely social impacts  \\nImportantly, digital services are fundamental means of communication \\u2013 from offering the infrastructure, to \\nintermediating flows of information. Greater trust that citizens\\u2019 safety is protected will also ensure greater uptake of \\ndigital services. The analysis will also assess impacts on the protection of consumers against illegal goods sold \\nonline, a reduction of hate speech online, better protection of minors as well as emerging systemic harms with an \\nimpact on our society and our democratic systems. The ability for public authorities to effectively ensure that the \\nlaw is applied online will also be taken into account. \\nLikely environmental impacts \\nEnvironmental impacts are expected to be relatively marginal for all options compared to the baseline. The \\ninitiative is not expected, following an initial assessment, to increase environmental footprint of digital services, nor \\nthe absolute volumes of e-commerce compared to the baseline, even though the shipping of illegal goods is \\nexpected to decrease significantly. However, given the variety of sectors online platforms are active in (tourism \\nactivities, sales of goods, transport, etc.), the environmental implications could also be diverse and the Impact \\nAssessment would need to analyse them in more detail. \\nLikely impacts on fundamental rights \\nA range of fundamental rights are affected by the regulation of intermediaries, as confirmed by case law of the \\nCJEU and the ECHR. This concerns in particular, but not exclusively, the freedom to receive and impart \\n  \\n7 \\ninformation and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers and the right to an \\neffective remedy. The options will be assessed in particular against the opportunity to design at EU level a system \\nwith the appropriate and effective checks and balances to ensure that fundamental rights are protected online. \\nThe impact assessment will pay particular attention to direct effects and incentives which could lead to the \\nrestriction of any fundamental right. Where there is a risk that such negative impacts could emerge, appropriate \\nresponses will be designed to ensure effective redress and a fair balance for the protection of rights online, in \\ncompliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and international standards.  \\nOther fundamental rights to be considered relate in particular to the protection of personal data and privacy, non-\\ndiscrimination and gender equality, freedom of assembly, the rights of the child, the right to an effective remedy, \\nthe freedom to conduct a business and the protection of intellectual property.  \\nLikely impacts on simplification and/or administrative burden \\nWhereas all options are expected to lead to some costs on public authorities for smooth enforcement and \\ncooperation, it is likely that these costs will be counterbalanced by the significant efficiency gains in the \\nenforcement of the law across the Union. This will be further assessed in the Impact Assessment. \\nD. Evidence base, Data collection and Better Regulation Instruments  \\nImpact assessment \\nFollowing the evaluation of the e-Commerce Directive, an Impact Assessment will be conducted to further define \\nthe problem analysis and the policy options and to compare their impacts. The Impact Assessment is expected to \\nbe finalised and submitted to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board of the European Commission in the second half of \\n2020.   \\nEvidence base and data collection  \\nThe evaluation and the impact assessment will further build on detailed evidence gathered over the past years9, in \\nparticular concerning the legal assessment of current implementation of the e-Commerce Directive and evidence \\nof emerging legal fragmentation. In addition, more granular data is being collected regularly on specific types of \\nillegal content and goods in the context of the structured dialogues and voluntary cooperation coordinated by the \\nCommission on several policy areas such as unsafe products, illegal hate speech, child sexual abuse material \\n(and related cooperation between law enforcement, hotlines and industry), counterfeit products, dissemination of \\nterrorist content, amongst others. Evidence will be also gathered through the parallel initiative on the evaluation \\nand revision of the General Product Safety Directive. \\nThe Commission will further launch targeted studies in particular in relation to the economic analysis underpinning \\nthe impact assessment, the state of the art in content moderation technologies, as well as evolution of certain \\ndigital services. \\nConsultation strategy  \\nThe evaluation and the impact assessment will be underpinned by a broad stakeholder consultation, with a \\nthreefold objective:  \\n- \\nGather stakeholders\\u2019 views on the current and emerging problems in the environment of digital services \\n- \\nGather evidence and concrete data underpinning the problems \\n- \\nCollect informed views on the potential policy approach, options, and perceived impacts.  \\nThe consultation strategy will in particular aim at collecting views from the most concerned stakeholders, including \\nusers of online platforms (and organisations representing their interests), digital services and intermediaries \\nranging from internet service providers, to cloud infrastructure services, content distribution networks, cloud-based \\nsoftware services, domain names service providers, etc., third party businesses involved in the ecosystem (such \\nas providers of content moderation tools, users of online platforms, payment providers, data intermediaries, \\nadvertisers, content creators, right holders, brands, etc.) and organisations representing them; civil society \\nrepresenting different interests such as the protection of digital rights, consumer protection, defence of vulnerable \\ngroups \\nand \\nvictims, \\nsocial \\npartners, \\nand \\nother \\nbusiness \\nor \\nemployee \\nassociations, \\nindividual \\nprofessionals/workers, as well as national authorities and academia, and individual citizens. \\nThe consultation strategy will include an online open public consultation, covering a wider spectrum of issues and \\nproblems than the scope of this Inception Impact Assessment, as well as a series of targeted consultation tools, \\nincluding expert workshops and an exchange of experience with Member States.  \\n                                                 \\n9 Some of the references are already presented in more detail in annexes of the Impact Assessment conducted in 2018 \\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-preventing-terrorist-content-online-swd-408_en.pdf  \\n  \\n8 \\nWill an Implementation plan be established?  \\nPending further analysis of the options and their complexity in the impact assessment, an implementation plan \\ncould be developed. \\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Issue: In the physical world Know Your Business Customer processes are already applied in a number of sectors, such as in the financial and legal services sectors, to fight money laundering and other forms of financial crime by ensuring that the identities of new clients are verified and accurate client data are being held by the service providers. In the EU, such obligations were already introduced for many sectors since the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive in . Equally, corporate entities are required to disclose their accurate legal addresses and identities of responsible individuals, which is essential in enforcing the law and holding them accountable. Similarly, application of KYBC rules to digital services would make it harder for dodgy companies and entrepreneurs to operate online, without regard to copyright, consumer protection, tax, and other applicable legislation.\",\n          \"by reference to exposure to a wider audience.

They should also provide clear information about any internal complaints mechanisms. Transparency reports: companies should publish detailed information consistent with the Santa Clara Principles that have been developed by experts in the field. We note that it is particularly important not to limit statistical information to removal of content but also include data about the number of appeals processed and their outcome. Transparency reporting should also distinguish between content flagged by third-parties (including whether they are public bodies or private entities), trusted flaggers (whether public bodies or private entities) or algorithms. Further information should also be provided in relation to the different types of restrictions applied to content as part of content moderation processes, such as demonetisation or downgrading; for every restriction, the company should give information about the rules on the basis of which the decision was made and, where available, the outcome of any appeals. More generally, we note that any transparency reporting requirements should aim to provide far more qualitative analysis of content moderation decisions.\",\n          \"Rue des deux glises , Brussels | Phone: + | | @AEReurope EU Interest Representative Register ID Number: - includes the prohibition of certain unfair trading practices.

This would go hand in hand with the case-by-case approach proposed by the Commission. Building on the Commissions proposed policy option (in its inception impact assessment), we have identified a number of practices that should be prohibited. Large online platforms should also be compelled to follow and adopt commitments to ensure a fair-trading environment online. Practices prohibited in a principles-based list should include: - The imposition of take it or leave it terms and conditions; - Discrimination (or self-preferencing) by a platform in favour of its own services or any other services; - Refusal to provide algorithmic transparency; - Abuse of smaller competitors by taking advantage of their user base; - The collection and use of customer data without prior authorisation; - Refusal to share datasets which are necessary to compete; - Leveraging its market power to enter other markets, e.g.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"x\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 7.227995514822868,\n        \"min\": -16.40648078918457,\n        \"max\": 20.573869705200195,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7473,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -3.1725542545318604,\n          2.52712082862854,\n          -15.834721565246582\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"y\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6.996247067177033,\n        \"min\": -17.490568161010742,\n        \"max\": 24.216442108154297,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7470,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -9.148841857910156,\n          3.11645245552063,\n          -3.7778170108795166\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Issue: In the physical world Know Your Business Customer processes are already applied in a number of sectors, such as in the financial and legal services sectors, to fight money laundering and other forms of financial crime by ensuring that the identities of new clients are verified and accurate client data are being held by the service providers. In the EU, such obligations were already introduced for many sectors since the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive in . Equally, corporate entities are required to disclose their accurate legal addresses and identities of responsible individuals, which is essential in enforcing the law and holding them accountable.

Transparency reports: companies should publish detailed information consistent with the Santa Clara Principles that have been developed by experts in the field. We note that it is particularly important not to limit statistical information to removal of content but also include data about the number of appeals processed and their outcome. Transparency reporting should also distinguish between content flagged by third-parties (including whether they are public bodies or private entities), trusted flaggers (whether public bodies or private entities) or algorithms. Further information should also be provided in relation to the different types of restrictions applied to content as part of content moderation processes, such as demonetisation or downgrading; for every restriction, the company should give information about the rules on the basis of which the decision was made and, where available, the outcome of any appeals.

In the EU, such obligations were already introduced for many sectors since the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive in . Equally, corporate entities are required to disclose their accurate legal addresses and identities of responsible individuals, which is essential in enforcing the law and holding them accountable. Similarly, application of KYBC rules to digital services would make it harder for dodgy companies and entrepreneurs to operate online, without regard to copyright, consumer protection, tax, and other applicable legislation.\",\n          \"by reference to exposure to a wider audience. Decision-making: companies should notify their decisions to affected parties and give sufficiently detailed reasons for the actions they take against particular content or The French government Facebook Mission Interim Report, July . accounts. They should also provide clear information about any internal complaints mechanisms. Transparency reports: companies should publish detailed information consistent with the Santa Clara Principles that have been developed by experts in the field. We note that it is particularly important not to limit statistical information to removal of content but also include data about the number of appeals processed and their outcome. Transparency reporting should also distinguish between content flagged by third-parties (including whether they are public bodies or private entities), trusted flaggers (whether public bodies or private entities) or algorithms. Further information should also be provided in relation to the different types of restrictions applied to content as part of content moderation processes, such as demonetisation or downgrading; for every restriction, the company should give information about the rules on the basis of which the decision was made and, where available, the outcome of any appeals. More generally, we note that any transparency reporting requirements should aim to provide far more qualitative analysis of content moderation decisions.\",\n          \"Rue des deux glises , Brussels | Phone: + | | @AEReurope EU Interest Representative Register ID Number: - includes the prohibition of certain unfair trading practices. Such practices should be listed in a principles-based list of obligations and prohibited practices, and (complementary) sector specific lists of obligations and prohibited practices, including a list of prohibitions and obligations specifically relevant to the digital audio sector. This would go hand in hand with the case-by-case approach proposed by the Commission. Building on the Commissions proposed policy option (in its inception impact assessment), we have identified a number of practices that should be prohibited. Large online platforms should also be compelled to follow and adopt commitments to ensure a fair-trading environment online. Practices prohibited in a principles-based list should include: - The imposition of take it or leave it terms and conditions; - Discrimination (or self-preferencing) by a platform in favour of its own services or any other services; - Refusal to provide algorithmic transparency; - Abuse of smaller competitors by taking advantage of their user base; - The collection and use of customer data without prior authorisation; - Refusal to share datasets which are necessary to compete; - Leveraging its market power to enter other markets, e.g.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"x\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 7.227995514822868,\n        \"min\": -16.40648078918457,\n        \"max\": 20.573869705200195,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7473,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -3.1725542545318604,\n          2.52712082862854,\n          -15.834721565246582\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"y\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6.996247067177033,\n        \"min\": -17.490568161010742,\n        \"max\": 24.216442108154297,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7470,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -9.148841857910156,\n          3.11645245552063,\n          -3.7778170108795166\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_cluster\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 71,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 73,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -1,\n          46,\n          43\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 73,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Outlier\",\n          \"Topic 46: cma market market study\",\n          \"Topic 43: automated content tools\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
